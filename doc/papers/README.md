## Publication Strategy

### Tier 1: Technical Journals
Papers 1 and 2 demonstrate technical innovation within specific computational domains, making them suitable for high-impact technical journals. The integration of theoretical insights generates novel algorithmic approaches that advance both technical and theoretical understanding.

### Tier 2: Interdisciplinary Venues
Paper 3 presents the broader framework and could appear in interdisciplinary venues focusing on technology studies, digital humanities, or critical theory. This positioning emphasizes the methodological contribution to multiple fields.

### Tier 3: Critical Theory Journals
Additional papers could be developed focusing primarily on theoretical contributions to queer theory, spatial justice, or critical algorithm studies, with technical implementation as supporting evidence.

## Research Impact Potential

### Computer Science Contributions
- Novel algorithmic approaches that solve technical problems while embodying critical insights
- Demonstration that political engagement enhances rather than constrains technical innovation
- New research directions in computational intelligence, geometric algorithms, and spatial computation

### Digital Humanities Contributions
- Methodology for moving beyond textual analysis to computational design
- Framework for creating rather than merely critiquing technological systems
- Tools for making abstract theoretical concepts computationally concrete

### Critical Theory Contributions
- Demonstration of how theoretical insights can generate practical innovations
- Extension of queer theory into computational domains
- Model for engaged scholarship that creates rather than only analyzes
