# The sum on the bench

In AirMusic one note could begin while another was already fading. Here a wave is waiting to be taken apart.

A bench stands against the north wall of the laboratory. Above it a dark board carries a pale wave with five coloured rows beneath it, and the wave already has a shape when you arrive: a long slope down and a steep rise, four times across the board, drifting to the left. On the bench, at its right end, five sliders stand in a column, one for each row.

<!-- @additive_wave_demo -->

Read the rows before you touch anything. The top row is one smooth rise and fall per cycle; each row below has more, two, three, four, five, and each is drawn smaller than the one above. None of them looks like the pale wave. Press HOLD on the panel at the left of the bench and the drift stops, so a place on the board stays where it is.

Now take the four lower sliders down, one at a time, and keep your eye on the pale wave while each row leaves the ladder. What remains is the top row, drawn larger: a sine. Press BASELINE and the four return together; press H1 ALONE and they leave together. The shape you arrived at is not one thing with a slope in it. It is five smooth returns added, and the slope belongs to none of them.

Bring the second row back on its own slider and choose a place on the board. The amber line marked *mark* is one such place. Before you raise the third slider, decide what the sum will do there: the third row is at a crest, or crossing its middle, or in a trough, and its slider decides how much of that is admitted. Raise it and read the plate on the bench. Its third line lists each row's value at the mark; the fourth adds them and prints the total drawn beside them. With these five visible rows, their sum agrees with the total. The pale wave is built by this loop:

```gdscript
	var value = 0.0
	for h in range(harmonic_amplitudes.size()):
		value += harmonic_amplitudes[h] * sin(phase * (h + 1))
	return value
```

Row h is a sine at h + 1 times the phase, scaled by its coefficient, and the sum is the running total. There is no separate drawing of "the wave". The pale line is this loop evaluated 256 times across two metres,

```gdscript
const WAVE_POINTS: int = 256
const WAVE_LENGTH: float = 2.0  # Visual length in meters
const NUM_HARMONICS: int = 5
```

with the phase running four cycles across the board and the clock adding the drift you stopped with HOLD:

```gdscript
		var phase = t * TAU * 4.0 + _time * TAU
```

A slider changes exactly one number. When a handle moves, the instrument reads the handle's position back as that row's coefficient:

```gdscript
		harmonic_amplitudes[harmonic_index] = harmonic_sliders[harmonic_index].get_normalized_value()
```

Even the first slider only changes how much of the first return is present. This is a visual instrument; it does not play the curve as sound. No slider changes the fundamental's frequency. The rows use integer multiples of one phase, so the vocabulary here is five amounts. Unlike the separately struck bars, these rows cannot choose separate beginnings. A shifted row or a negative amount would need a control this bench does not offer. BASELINE returns them to the table the room was placed with:

```gdscript
		"sawtooth":
			# Sawtooth: all harmonics, amplitude 1/n
			_set_amplitudes([1.0, 0.5, 0.333, 0.25, 0.2])
```

one over n, all five present, the recipe the label calls a sawtooth. The plate's last line names every coefficient that differs from this table, so you can wander and still know how far you have gone.

With the baseline held, look at the rise. An ideal sawtooth jumps; this one climbs from trough to crest over about nine centimetres of a fifty-centimetre cycle. Its descent ripples where the ideal would be straight. Raise the fifth slider and those ripples change. The baseline peaks near 1.58; other amounts can rise further. Five smooth returns can suggest a corner and cannot make an exact one. From across the room the pale line suggests a sawtooth. At the bench its rounded rise remains available to inspect.

Take the second and fourth rows out and leave the odd three; the label offers a name. Move the fifth a little. At first the name stays. Move further and it gives way to Custom Waveform. The curve has changed continuously; the naming rule crossed a threshold. It checks all five amounts relative to the first, allowing a small difference from a recipe. Custom is a place to continue from.

Then remove the row you think matters least and find where its absence shows. It is not in one place, because each row runs the whole cycle. Near zero, a row disappears before its coefficient reaches zero: the display hides values below 0.01 while the sum still includes them. At some marks the plate can report a difference between the visible rows and the total. Something has left the picture without leaving the calculation.

<!-- @ -->

BASELINE restores the five amounts. While HOLD keeps the phase still, the same curve returns to the same place. Let the clock run and those amounts return as a moving shape. Repeating a recipe and repeating an exact instant ask for different things to be kept. Random_Definition takes that question further: what must we retain to bring an unfamiliar result back?
