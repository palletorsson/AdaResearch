AdaResearch appears to be a Godot 4 research and learning platform that fuses interactive algorithm exhibits, custom audio synthesis tools, and VR-first navigation into a single cohesive laboratory. The repository blends desktop and headset workflows, but the scene loader, VR staging areas, and grid interaction systems show the team is prioritizing immersive exploration while still supporting keyboard and mouse users.

Core content lives under `algorithms/`, where hundreds of standalone 3D scenes illustrate topics that range from classic pathfinding and convex hulls to reaction-diffusion chemistry, quantum concepts, emergent systems, and machine learning sketches. Each algorithm scene follows a consistent Node3D template with controller scripts, cameras, UI, and materials so that demonstrations can be swapped in and out while retaining a familiar interaction model. `MainSceneLoader.gd` then stitches everything together: it discovers valid scenes from `algorithms.json`, tracks category metadata, and lets a first-person player cycle through the library (load, unload, reload, step forwards/back). The loader exposes the current scene and location in an in-world UI and keeps player metrics like distance to the active exhibit for comfort in VR.

Shared infrastructure under `commons/` supplies the building blocks that make the exhibits work. There is a modular grid system for spatial interactions, scene templates (labs, staging areas, grids), reusable primitives like instrumented cubes, context environments (disco floors, coordinate spaces, walk grids), and management scripts that coordinate progression, lab states, and VR-specific behaviours. These modules are intentionally component-oriented so features (audio hooks, hazard logic, monitors, map overlays) can be composed without deep inheritance chains. Documentation across these folders is verbose—even if some markdown contains mojibake emoji codes—highlighting the emphasis on maintainability and onboarding.

One standout subsystem is the recently restructured audio suite in `commons/audio/`. It provides development-facing sound design interfaces, runtime synthesis engines, and over seventy parameter presets spanning basic waveforms, synth emulations, retro tones, atmospheric beds, and experimental soundscapes. The `EnhancedParameterLoader` consolidates three historical JSON layouts into a single API, guarded by defensive checks and validation scripts. Interfaces such as `SoundDesignerInterface.gd` pair real-time waveform/spectrum visualisation with educational music theory notes, aligning with the broader goal of blending pedagogy and creation.

The documentation in `doc/` and scattered READMEs frame the project as an expanding research lab. Guides walk through lab grid layouts, scene sequence orchestration, and progression pacing, suggesting structured learning paths rather than isolated demos. Meanwhile, automation scripts in the repository tidy Godot resources, reconcile UID mismatches, normalise cylinder meshes, and enforce formatting—evidence of large-scale content management.

Taken together, AdaResearch is less a single game and more an extensible XR playground for computational thinking. Users enter a hub, pick algorithmic or audio experiences, and manipulate parameters while observing immediate 3D and auditory feedback. The emphasis on VR support, consistent scene architecture, and a sprawling curated content set indicates the project aims to become a comprehensive, immersive library for algorithms, creative coding, and sound design research.
