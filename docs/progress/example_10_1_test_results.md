# Example 10.1: Perceptron Classifier - Test Results

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Chapter**: 10 - Neural Networks
**Example**: 10.1 - Perceptron (Basic Classifier)
**Status**: ⚠️ Ready for VR Testing

---

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Built:

**Core Logic** (`example_10_1_perceptron.gd`):
- Perceptron classifier learning to separate points above/below a line
- Target function: `y = 0.5 * x + 0.1`
- 100 training points randomly distributed in fish tank
- Auto-training mode with adjustable speed
- Real-time visualization of decision boundary

**Training Point Class** (`training_point.gd`):
- Visual representation of data points as small spheres
- Color coding:
  - **Bright pink** (class +1): Points above the line
  - **Blue** (class -1): Points below the line
  - **Green**: Correctly classified
  - **Red**: Misclassified
- Updates color in real-time during training

**Visual Components**:
1. **Fish Tank**: 1m³ transparent pink cube boundary
2. **Target Line**: Yellow glowing line (the true separator)
3. **Decision Boundary**: Pink transparent plane (perceptron's current hypothesis)
4. **Training Points**: 100 colored spheres
5. **Info Label**: Floating Label3D showing iterations and accuracy
6. **Learning Rate Controller**: 3D slider (0.001 - 0.1)

**Scene Structure**:
```
grid.tscn (VR player + controllers)
  └─ GridScene/
      └─ FishTank (pink transparent cube)
          └─ PerceptronClassifier
              ├─ target_line (yellow)
              ├─ decision_plane (pink)
              ├─ info_label (white text)
              ├─ learning_rate_controller (3D slider)
              └─ training_points (100x colored spheres)
```

## Expected Behavior

### On Startup:
1. Fish tank appears with pink transparent walls
2. 100 training points spawn randomly in XY plane
3. Points colored pink (above line) or blue (below line)
4. Yellow target line visible
5. Pink decision plane starts at random orientation
6. Training begins automatically

### During Training:
1. One random point selected per iteration (0.1s interval)
2. Perceptron weights updated
3. Decision boundary (pink plane) rotates/translates
4. All points re-classified and recolored:
   - Green if correctly classified
   - Red if misclassified
5. Info label updates: "Iterations: X, Accuracy: Y%"
6. Accuracy should approach 100% as decision boundary converges

### Interactive Features:
1. **Learning Rate Slider**: Adjust perceptron.learning_rate (0.001 - 0.1)
   - Higher = faster convergence but less stable
   - Lower = slower convergence but more precise

## VR Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Scene Loads**: Does the scene open in Godot?
- [ ] **VR Mode**: Can you enter VR headset mode?
- [ ] **Fish Tank Visible**: Is the 1m pink cube boundary visible?
- [ ] **Training Points**: Are 100 spheres spawned?
- [ ] **Point Colors**: Pink/blue initial colors correct?
- [ ] **Target Line**: Yellow line visible?
- [ ] **Decision Boundary**: Pink plane visible and moving?
- [ ] **Auto-Training**: Does training start automatically?
- [ ] **Color Updates**: Do points turn green/red during training?
- [ ] **Convergence**: Does accuracy reach ~100%?
- [ ] **Info Label**: Is text readable and updating?
- [ ] **Learning Rate Slider**: Can you grab and adjust it?
- [ ] **Performance**: Maintaining 90+ FPS?

## Known Issues (Pre-Test)

### Potential Issues:
1. ⚠️ **Scene File**: `.tscn` file may need UID adjustments for grid.tscn reference
2. ⚠️ **FishTank Reference**: Script assumes FishTank is sibling, needs testing
3. ⚠️ **Parameter Controller**: Grab interaction not yet wired to VR controllers
4. ⚠️ **Label3D Billboard**: May not face camera correctly in VR
5. ⚠️ **Plane Rotation**: Decision boundary rotation math needs verification

### Missing Features:
- No manual point placement (could add with controller raycast)
- No pause/reset buttons (only script methods exist)
- No weight visualization (could show weight values on screen)

## Notes

- This is the FIRST example in the reverse-order implementation (10 → 08 → 06 → 04 → 02 → 00)
- Starting with most advanced chapter (Neural Networks) to test architecture
- Perceptron is simplest NN, good foundation test
- If this works, proves core systems (FishTank, VREntity, pink materials, 3D UI) are solid
