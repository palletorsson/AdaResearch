# Affect Theory Visualization

## Overview
Affect theory visualization is a computational approach that simulates and visualizes emotional and affective states through soft body physics. It combines psychological affect theory with physical simulation to create interactive representations of emotional dynamics and their physical manifestations.

## What is Affect Theory Visualization?
Affect theory visualization uses soft body physics to represent emotional states and their transitions. By mapping emotional concepts to physical properties like tension, elasticity, and movement, it provides an intuitive way to understand and interact with complex emotional dynamics.

## Basic Structure

### Emotional Mapping
- **Valence**: Positive/negative emotional state mapped to color and shape
- **Arousal**: Energy level mapped to movement speed and amplitude
- **Dominance**: Control level mapped to size and stability
- **Complexity**: Emotional nuance mapped to geometric complexity

### Physical Properties
- **Tension**: Represents emotional stress or anxiety
- **Elasticity**: Represents emotional flexibility and resilience
- **Damping**: Represents emotional regulation and control
- **Mass**: Represents emotional weight or significance

### Visual Elements
- **Color**: Emotional valence and intensity
- **Shape**: Emotional complexity and structure
- **Movement**: Emotional dynamics and flow
- **Texture**: Emotional granularity and detail

## Types of Affect Visualization

### Basic Emotion States
- **Joy**: Bright colors, upward movement, smooth shapes
- **Sadness**: Dark colors, downward movement, drooping forms
- **Anger**: Red colors, rapid movement, sharp edges
- **Fear**: Pale colors, trembling movement, shrinking forms

### Complex Emotional States
- **Ambivalence**: Mixed colors, conflicting movements
- **Confusion**: Chaotic patterns, irregular shapes
- **Serenity**: Calm colors, gentle movements, flowing forms
- **Excitement**: Vibrant colors, energetic movements

### Emotional Transitions
- **Gradual Change**: Smooth interpolation between states
- **Sudden Shifts**: Abrupt changes in properties
- **Cycling**: Repeating emotional patterns
- **Evolution**: Long-term emotional development

## Core Operations

### Emotion Input
- **User Interaction**: Direct emotional input through controls
- **Sensor Data**: Physiological or behavioral data
- **Text Analysis**: Emotional content from text input
- **Audio Analysis**: Emotional tone from voice input

### Physical Simulation
- **Soft Body Physics**: Deformable object simulation
- **Force Application**: Emotional forces affecting shape
- **Constraint Solving**: Maintaining emotional coherence
- **Collision Response**: Emotional boundaries and limits

### Visual Rendering
- **Color Mapping**: Convert emotions to visual properties
- **Shape Deformation**: Emotional state affecting geometry
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions between states
- **Effects**: Additional visual enhancements
