# VR Water Flowers Scene (Physics Update)

## ðŸŒ¸ Installation Complete!

This folder contains a complete Godot 4 scene featuring a realistic water surface with physically simulated floating flowers.

### Files Created:
- `WaterFlowersVR.gd`: The main GDScript that controls all scene logic.
- `WaterFlowersVR.tscn`: The Godot scene file.
- `README_WaterFlowers.md`: This instruction file.

### Scene Features:
- **Advanced Water Shader**: Uses a sum of four Gerstner-like wave components ("resonant frequencies") to create a complex, realistic water surface with sharp peaks.
- **True Floating Physics**: Flowers are now `RigidBody3D` nodes that dynamically react to the water.
- **Buoyancy Simulation**: A damped spring force keeps flowers at the water's surface, creating natural bobbing.
- **Wave Alignment**: Flowers tilt and align with the slope of the waves they are riding on.
- **Procedural Flowers**: Several types of flowers are generated with unique colors and shapes.

### How to Use:

1.  **Copy Files**: Copy `WaterFlowersVR.gd` and `WaterFlowersVR.tscn` into your Godot project.
2.  **Add to Your VR World**: Drag `WaterFlowersVR.tscn` into your main VR scene.
3.  **Run**: The scene is self-contained and will run as is.

### Customization in the Inspector:

Select the `WaterFlowersVR` node to adjust these properties:

-   `Flower Count`: Total number of flowers.
-   `Water Size`: The dimensions of the water plane.
-   `Wave Strength`: An overall multiplier for the height of all waves.
-   `Animation Speed`: Controls the speed of the water waves.

### Technical Details:
- The GDScript function `get_water_state_at_position()` perfectly mirrors the `gerstner_wave()` calculations in the shader, ensuring that the physics simulation is always in sync with the visual water mesh.
- The `_physics_process` loop handles all flower movement, applying buoyancy, alignment torque, and drift forces for a realistic simulation.
