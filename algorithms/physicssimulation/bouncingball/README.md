# Bouncing Ball Physics Visualization

## Overview
This scene demonstrates realistic bouncing ball physics with multiple balls, obstacles, and collision detection. It showcases momentum conservation, energy loss, and complex collision interactions in a 3D environment.

## Features
- **Multiple Balls**: Three balls with different initial conditions and colors
- **Environment**: Ground plane, walls, and obstacles for collision testing
- **Realistic Physics**: Gravity, air resistance, and collision response
- **Collision Detection**: Ball-to-ball and ball-to-environment interactions
- **Visual Trails**: Path visualization for each ball

## Physics Implementation
- **Gravity**: Constant downward acceleration (9.8 m/sÂ²)
- **Air Resistance**: Velocity damping for realistic motion
- **Collision Detection**: AABB-based collision detection system
- **Impulse Response**: Momentum-conserving collision resolution
- **Energy Loss**: Realistic bouncing with energy dissipation

## Controls
- **Reset Balls**: Restores all balls to initial positions
- **Pause/Resume**: Toggles physics simulation on/off

## Technical Details
- **Engine**: Godot 4
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Scene Type**: 3D Visualization
- **Physics**: Custom collision detection and response
- **Collision System**: Broad-phase and narrow-phase detection
