# Soft Body 3D Physics Variations

A comprehensive demonstration scene showcasing different types of soft body physics with interactive elements, state management, and educational demonstrations.

## üéØ Overview

This scene demonstrates multiple soft body variations with different physics properties and behaviors. The main attraction is **10 sphere soft bodies** with varying simulation precision and pressure coefficients, plus additional soft body types (box, cylinder, capsule). The scene automatically cycles through different demonstration modes and provides interactive controls for hands-on exploration of soft body physics.

## üß± Soft Body Variations

### **10 Sphere Variations** (Main Demonstration)
The scene features 10 identical sphere meshes with different physics configurations arranged in two rows:

- **SphereSoftBody02**: Precision 6, Pressure 0.1 - Soft, basic physics
- **SphereSoftBody03**: Precision 7, Pressure 0.15 - Medium-soft
- **SphereSoftBody04**: Precision 8, Pressure 0.2 - Balanced behavior
- **SphereSoftBody05**: Precision 9, Pressure 0.25 - Slightly firmer

**Front Row (Z = -3)**: Medium to High Pressure (0.3 - 1.0)
- **SphereSoftBody06**: Precision 10, Pressure 0.3 - Firm, detailed
- **SphereSoftBody07**: Precision 12, Pressure 0.4 - Very firm
- **SphereSoftBody08**: Precision 15, Pressure 0.5 - High pressure
