# Physics Simulation Algorithms Collection

## Overview
This collection contains 10 standalone 3D visualization scenes demonstrating various physics simulation algorithms. Each scene is designed to be educational, interactive, and ready for integration into XR environments.

## Algorithms Included

### 1. [Newton's Laws](./newtonslaws/)
Demonstrates fundamental principles of classical mechanics including gravity, applied forces, and friction through interactive 3D visualization.

### 2. [Vector Fields](./vectorfields/)
Shows various types of vector fields (radial, vortex, uniform, sinusoidal) and their effects on particle motion with real-time field visualization.

### 3. [Three-Body Problem](./threebodyproblem/)
Illustrates the famous three-body gravitational problem, revealing the chaotic nature of multi-body gravitational systems.

### 4. [Bouncing Ball Physics](./bouncingball/)
Demonstrates realistic bouncing ball physics with multiple balls, obstacles, and collision detection using momentum conservation.

### 5. [Rigid Body Dynamics](./rigidbody/)
Shows rigid body physics with stacking, tumbling, and complex collision interactions between multiple blocks.

### 6. [Constraints](./constraints/)
Demonstrates mechanical constraint systems including hinges, sliders, and pendulums with visual constraint indicators.

### 7. [Spring-Mass Systems](./springmass/)
Illustrates Hooke's Law and spring physics through interconnected mass points with dynamic spring visualization.

### 8. [Fluid Simulation (SPH)](./fluidsimulation/)
Implements Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for realistic fluid behavior with pressure, viscosity, and boundary forces.

### 9. [Collision Detection](./collisiondetection/)
Demonstrates broad-phase (spatial hashing) and narrow-phase (AABB) collision detection algorithms with visual feedback.

### 10. [Numerical Integration](./numericalintegration/)
Compares different integration methods (Euler, RK4, Analytical) for solving differential equations with adjustable precision.
