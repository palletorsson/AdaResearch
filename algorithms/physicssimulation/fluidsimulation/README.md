# Fluid Simulation (SPH) Visualization

## Overview
This scene demonstrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) fluid simulation, showing how fluid particles interact through pressure, viscosity, and boundary forces. It provides a realistic representation of fluid behavior in 3D space.

## Features
- **Fluid Particles**: Individual particles representing fluid elements
- **SPH Algorithm**: Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics implementation
- **Pressure Forces**: Density-based pressure calculations
- **Viscosity**: Fluid internal friction simulation
- **Boundary Collisions**: Container wall interactions
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Particle size and color changes based on density

## Physics Implementation
- **SPH Core**: Density calculation using smoothing kernels
- **Pressure Forces**: F = -âˆ‡P pressure gradient forces
- **Viscosity Forces**: Velocity smoothing between particles
- **Boundary Handling**: Collision detection with container walls
- **Real-time Integration**: Continuous particle physics updates

## Controls
- **Reset Fluid**: Restores all particles to initial positions
- **Pause/Resume**: Toggles fluid simulation on/off

## Technical Details
- **Engine**: Godot 4
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Scene Type**: 3D Visualization
- **Physics**: SPH fluid dynamics implementation
- **Visualization**: Dynamic particle rendering with density-based properties
