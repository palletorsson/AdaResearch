## Abstract

We present the first interactive 3D computational model of Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle, implementing dynamic Markov blankets as living boundary systems that mediate between internal and external states. Our implementation transforms abstract mathematical frameworks into embodied, experiential visualization, revealing how biological systems maintain organization through active inference and predictive error minimization. The system demonstrates real-time entropy dynamics, information flow visualization, and membrane-mediated boundary dissolution, offering unprecedented insight into the computational basis of life and consciousness.

## 1. Introduction

Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle (FEP) represents one of the most ambitious unifying theories in contemporary neuroscience, proposing that all biological systems can be understood as engaging in variational Bayesian inference to minimize surprise and maintain structural integrity. At the heart of this framework lies the concept of Markov blankets: statistical boundaries that separate internal states from external states while mediating their interaction.

This paper presents the first interactive 3D computational visualization of these principles, transforming mathematical abstraction into embodied, experiential understanding.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Free Energy Principle Foundations

The Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems persist by minimizing their free energy—a quantity that bounds surprise about sensory observations. Markov blankets partition the world into four distinct sets:

- **Internal states (η)**: The system's internal organization
- **External states (ψ)**: Environmental factors beyond direct interaction  
- **Sensory states (s)**: Boundary states influenced by external states
- **Active states (a)**: Boundary states that influence external states

### 2.2 Active Inference and Boundary Dynamics

Systems minimize free energy through:
1. **Perceptual inference**: Updating internal beliefs about external states
2. **Active inference**: Acting on the environment to fulfill predictions

This transforms the boundary from passive barrier into active, dynamic interface.

## 3. Implementation Architecture

### 3.1 3D Visualization Framework

Our implementation creates a multi-layered 3D environment:

**Inner World (Internal States)**
- Pulsating blue sphere representing internal organization
- Dynamic scaling based on confidence and prediction accuracy
- Emission properties reflecting internal entropy levels

**Membrane System (Markov Blanket)**  
- Orange translucent boundary implementing sensory/active state dynamics
- Real-time deformation based on information processing
- Adaptive material properties reflecting boundary permeability

**Outer Environment (External States)**
- Green ambient field representing environmental complexity
- Information hotspots generating prediction challenges
- Spatial distribution reflecting environmental entropy

### 3.2 Information Flow Dynamics

The system implements information flow through hotspot generation, membrane processing, and entropy dynamics:

```gdscript
func _adjust_entropy():
    var membrane_activity = 0
    for hotspot in information_hotspots:
        if hotspot.processed:
            membrane_activity += hotspot.intensity
    
    inner_entropy = clamp(inner_entropy + membrane_activity * 0.01, 0.1, 0.9)
    outer_entropy = clamp(outer_entropy + (randf() * 0.04 - 0.02), 0.2, 0.8)
```

## 4. Results and Observations

### 4.1 Entropy Visualization

The system successfully demonstrates key FEP predictions:

**Boundary Dynamics**: The membrane exhibits complex adaptive behavior, thickening and thinning based on information processing demands.

**Prediction Error Visualization**: Failed predictions generate visible disturbances that propagate through the system.

**Homeostatic Regulation**: The system maintains stable internal organization despite environmental perturbations.

### 4.2 Active Inference Mechanics

The visualization reveals active inference as a boundary phenomenon:

**Selective Attention**: The membrane preferentially processes certain information types
**Predictive Adaptation**: Repeated exposure leads to membrane adaptation
**Error Propagation**: Prediction errors create visible ripple effects

## 8. Conclusion

This work represents the first successful translation of the Free Energy Principle from mathematical abstraction to embodied computational experience. By creating interactive 3D visualizations of Markov blanket dynamics, we demonstrate how advanced theoretical neuroscience can be made accessible and scientifically productive.

The boundary between self and world emerges not as fixed barrier but as dynamic, living interface constituting the essence of biological existence. In making this visible, we contribute to deeper understanding of what it means to be alive, conscious, and engaged in making sense of our world.
