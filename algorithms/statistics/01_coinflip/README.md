# Interactive VR Coin Flip - Basic Probability

## Overview
This VR experience introduces fundamental probability concepts through interactive coin flipping. Players can physically flip a virtual coin using VR controllers and observe real-time statistical convergence toward theoretical probabilities.

## Educational Objectives
- **Basic Probability**: Understanding 50/50 outcomes
- **Law of Large Numbers**: How results approach theoretical probability with more trials
- **Statistical Deviation**: Observing variance from expected outcomes
- **Data Collection**: Recording and analyzing experimental results

## VR Interaction
- **Trigger/Grip Button**: Flip the coin with realistic physics
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time statistics display in 3D space
- **Physical Simulation**: Coin responds to physics with random outcomes
- **Statistical Charts**: 3D bar graphs showing probability convergence

## Algorithm Features
1. **Physics-Based Simulation**: Realistic coin flipping with torque and impulse
2. **Real-Time Statistics**: Live calculation of heads/tails probability
3. **Visual Analytics**: 3D charts showing expected vs actual results
4. **Progressive Learning**: Statistics become more accurate with more flips

## Statistical Concepts Demonstrated
- **Sample Space**: {Heads, Tails}
- **Probability**: P(Heads) = P(Tails) = 0.5
- **Frequency vs Probability**: How observed frequency approaches theoretical probability
- **Variance**: Natural deviation in small samples

## Parameters
- `max_flips`: Maximum number of coin flips (default: 1000)
- `coin_size`: Physical size of the coin (default: 0.1m)
- `flip_force`: Upward force applied to coin (default: 5.0)
- `spin_torque`: Rotational force for realistic tumbling (default: 10.0)

## Usage
1. Put on VR headset and grab controllers
2. Point at the coin and press trigger to flip
3. Watch the coin tumble and land
4. Observe statistics update in real-time
5. Continue flipping to see probability convergence

## Extensions
- Try predicting outcomes before flipping
- Compare short-term vs long-term results
- Analyze streaks and patterns in randomness
- Discuss why "hot hands" and "gambler's fallacy" are misconceptions
