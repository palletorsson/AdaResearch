# Interactive VR Normal Distribution - Continuous Probability

## Overview
This VR experience teaches the fundamental continuous distribution - the normal (Gaussian) distribution. Players can generate samples, adjust parameters, and visualize the famous bell curve while learning about the 68-95-99.7 rule and standardization.

## Educational Objectives
- **Continuous Distributions**: Understanding probability density functions
- **Normal Distribution Properties**: Mean, standard deviation, symmetry
- **68-95-99.7 Rule**: Empirical rule for standard deviations
- **Central Tendency**: How samples cluster around the mean
- **Parameter Effects**: How μ and σ change the distribution shape

## VR Interaction
- **Trigger**: Generate new set of random samples
- **Grip**: Clear current samples
- **Parameter Sliders**: Adjust mean and standard deviation in real-time
- **Falling Particles**: Watch samples "fall" into their histogram positions

## Algorithm Features
1. **Box-Muller Transform**: Generates true normal random variables
2. **Real-Time Visualization**: Theoretical curve vs empirical histogram
3. **Interactive Parameters**: Live adjustment of μ and σ
4. **Standard Deviation Regions**: Visual 68-95-99.7 rule overlay

## Statistical Concepts Demonstrated
- **Probability Density Function**: f(x) = (1/σ√2π)e^(-½((x-μ)/σ)²)
- **Standard Normal**: Z = (X - μ)/σ
- **Empirical Rule**: ~68% within ±1σ, ~95% within ±2σ, ~99.7% within ±3σ
- **Sample Convergence**: How sample statistics approach population parameters

## Key Features
- **Theoretical vs Empirical**: Compare mathematical curve with sample histogram
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: See immediate effects of changing μ and σ
- **Sample Statistics**: Live calculation of sample mean and standard deviation
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded standard deviation regions

## Usage
1. Generate samples using trigger button
2. Observe falling particles representing individual samples
3. Watch histogram build up showing sample distribution
4. Adjust parameters to see shape changes
5. Compare sample statistics with theoretical values

## Extensions
- Explore different sample sizes
- Compare multiple normal distributions
- Understand standardization (Z-scores)
- Prepare for Central Limit Theorem concepts
