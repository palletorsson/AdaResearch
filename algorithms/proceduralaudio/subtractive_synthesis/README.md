# Subtractive Synthesis

## Overview
This algorithm implements subtractive synthesis, a fundamental audio synthesis technique that starts with rich harmonic content and filters it to create desired sounds, demonstrating the principles of spectral manipulation in audio.

## Description
Subtractive synthesis begins with a harmonically rich waveform (like a sawtooth or square wave) and uses filters to remove unwanted frequencies, creating the desired timbre. This is one of the most common synthesis methods used in electronic music and sound design.

## Key Features
- **Rich Waveforms**: Starting with harmonically complex sources
- **Filter Systems**: Low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filtering
- **Envelope Control**: Dynamic filter parameter changes
