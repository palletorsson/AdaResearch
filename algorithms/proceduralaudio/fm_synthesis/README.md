# FM Synthesis

## Overview
This algorithm implements Frequency Modulation (FM) synthesis, a powerful audio synthesis technique that uses one oscillator to modulate the frequency of another, creating rich, complex timbres.

## Description
FM synthesis works by using a modulator oscillator to change the frequency of a carrier oscillator, creating sidebands and complex harmonic content. This technique was popularized by the Yamaha DX7 synthesizer and remains fundamental to modern sound design.

## Key Features
- **Carrier Oscillator**: The main sound-producing oscillator
- **Modulator Oscillator**: Controls the carrier's frequency
- **Modulation Index**: Controls the intensity of modulation
- **Harmonic Richness**: Complex timbral possibilities
- **Real-time Control**: Live parameter manipulation

## Use Cases
- **Electronic Music**: Creating synthesizer sounds
