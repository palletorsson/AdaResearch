# Granular Synthesis

## Overview
This algorithm implements granular synthesis, an advanced audio synthesis technique that works with tiny grains of sound to create complex textures and evolving timbres.

## Description
Granular synthesis breaks audio into small segments (grains) and manipulates them individually, allowing for complex sound design possibilities including time-stretching, pitch-shifting, and texture creation.

## Key Features
- **Grain Generation**: Creating and manipulating audio grains
- **Time Stretching**: Altering duration without pitch change
- **Pitch Shifting**: Changing pitch without duration change
- **Texture Creation**: Building complex soundscapes
- **Real-time Control**: Live manipulation of synthesis parameters

## Use Cases
- **Sound Design**: Creating evolving textures and atmospheres
- **Audio Effects**: Time and pitch manipulation
- **Experimental Music**: Pushing boundaries of sound creation
- **Film and Game Audio**: Atmospheric and ambient sounds

## Technical Implementation
The algorithm uses GDScript to create:
- Grain generation systems
- Time and pitch manipulation
- Grain scheduling algorithms
- Real-time audio processing
