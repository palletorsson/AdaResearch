# Rule 30/110 Cellular Automata

## Overview
This algorithm implements specific cellular automaton rules (Rule 30 and Rule 110), demonstrating how different rule sets can produce vastly different emergent behaviors and patterns from the same underlying system.

## Description
Rule 30 and Rule 110 are specific cellular automaton rules that produce distinct patterns. Rule 30 creates chaotic, seemingly random patterns, while Rule 110 can produce complex, structured patterns that are Turing complete. This implementation allows comparison and study of these fundamental rules.
