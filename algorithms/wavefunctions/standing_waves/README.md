# Standing Waves

## Overview
This algorithm visualizes standing waves, demonstrating how waves can interfere with themselves to create stationary patterns, fundamental to understanding acoustics, optics, and quantum mechanics.

## Description
Standing waves occur when two waves of the same frequency travel in opposite directions and interfere with each other, creating nodes (points of no motion) and antinodes (points of maximum motion). This is crucial for understanding musical instruments, optical cavities, and quantum wave functions.
