# A* Pathfinding Algorithm

## Overview
This algorithm implements the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm, one of the most efficient and widely-used pathfinding algorithms for finding optimal paths between two points in a graph or grid.

## Description
A* is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost to reach the goal, making it more efficient than uninformed search algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm. It's particularly effective for pathfinding in games, robotics, and navigation systems.

## Key Features
- **Heuristic-Based Search**: Uses estimated costs to guide search direction
- **Optimal Path Finding**: Guarantees shortest path when heuristic is admissible
- **Efficient Performance**: Faster than uninformed search algorithms
- **Visual Representation**: Clear visualization of search process
