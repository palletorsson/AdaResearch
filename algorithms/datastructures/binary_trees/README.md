# Binary Trees

## Overview
Binary trees are fundamental hierarchical data structures where each node has at most two children, typically called the left and right child. They form the foundation for many advanced data structures and algorithms in computer science.

## What are Binary Trees?
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node contains a value and references to at most two other nodes (children). The structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, making it essential for many applications.

## Structure and Properties

### Basic Components
- **Node**: Contains data and references to children
- **Root**: The topmost node of the tree
- **Leaf**: Nodes with no children
- **Internal Node**: Nodes with at least one child
- **Edge**: Connection between parent and child nodes

### Tree Properties
- **Height**: Maximum depth from root to any leaf
- **Size**: Total number of nodes in the tree
- **Balance**: Distribution of nodes across subtrees
- **Depth**: Distance from root to a specific node

## Types of Binary Trees

### Complete Binary Tree
- **Structure**: All levels are filled except possibly the last
- **Properties**: Efficient array representation
- **Applications**: Heap data structures, binary search trees

### Full Binary Tree
- **Structure**: Every node has 0 or 2 children
- **Properties**: No nodes with only one child
- **Applications**: Expression trees, decision trees

### Perfect Binary Tree
- **Structure**: All internal nodes have 2 children
- **Properties**: All leaves at the same level
- **Applications**: Complete binary heaps, perfect hashing

### Balanced Binary Tree
- **Structure**: Height difference between subtrees is limited
- **Properties**: O(log n) height for n nodes
- **Applications**: AVL trees, red-black trees

## Common Operations

### Traversal Algorithms
- **Inorder**: Left subtree → Root → Right subtree
- **Preorder**: Root → Left subtree → Right subtree
- **Postorder**: Left subtree → Right subtree → Root
- **Level-order**: Breadth-first traversal by levels

### Search Operations
- **Binary Search**: Efficient search in sorted trees
- **Depth-First Search**: Exploring deep paths first
- **Breadth-First Search**: Exploring level by level
- **Recursive Search**: Natural tree traversal approach

### Modification Operations
- **Insertion**: Adding new nodes while maintaining structure
- **Deletion**: Removing nodes and rebalancing
- **Rotation**: Restructuring to maintain balance
- **Rebalancing**: Adjusting tree structure after modifications

## Implementation Considerations

### Node Structure
```gdscript
class TreeNode:
    var data: Variant
    var left: TreeNode
    var right: TreeNode
    
    func _init(value: Variant):
        data = value
        left = null
        right = null
```

### Memory Management
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Creating nodes as needed
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic cleanup of unused nodes
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimizing overhead per node
- **Cache Locality**: Optimizing memory access patterns

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
- **Search**: O(log n) for balanced trees, O(n) worst case
- **Insertion**: O(log n) for balanced trees, O(n) worst case
- **Deletion**: O(log n) for balanced trees, O(n) worst case
- **Traversal**: O(n) for visiting all nodes

### Space Complexity
- **Storage**: O(n) for n nodes
- **Stack Space**: O(h) for recursive operations
- **Auxiliary Space**: O(1) for iterative operations
- **Overhead**: Minimal per-node storage

## Applications

### Data Organization
- **Binary Search Trees**: Efficient searching and sorting
- **Expression Trees**: Mathematical expression representation
- **Decision Trees**: Classification and decision making
- **File Systems**: Hierarchical file organization

### Algorithm Implementation
- **Sorting**: Tree sort and heap sort
- **Searching**: Binary search and tree search
- **Compression**: Huffman coding trees
- **Parsing**: Syntax tree construction

## Advanced Variants

### Self-Balancing Trees
- **AVL Trees**: Height-balanced binary search trees
- **Red-Black Trees**: Color-coded balancing scheme
- **Splay Trees**: Self-adjusting based on access patterns
- **Treaps**: Combination of binary search tree and heap

### Specialized Trees
- **B-Trees**: Multi-way trees for disk storage
- **Tries**: String-based tree structures
- **Segment Trees**: Range query optimization
- **Fenwick Trees**: Efficient prefix sum operations

## VR Visualization Benefits

## Common Pitfalls

### Implementation Issues
- **Null Pointer Errors**: Not checking for null children

- **Balance Violations**: Not maintaining tree properties

### Design Considerations
- **Over-engineering**: Adding unnecessary complexity
- **Memory Waste**: Allocating unused nodes
- **Performance Neglect**: Ignoring balance requirements
- **Scalability Issues**: Not considering large datasets

## Future Extensions
