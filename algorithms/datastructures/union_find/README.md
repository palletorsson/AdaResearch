# Union-Find Data Structure

## Overview
The Union-Find data structure (also known as Disjoint-Set Union or DSU) is a data structure that tracks a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It provides efficient operations for merging sets and finding which set an element belongs to.

## What is Union-Find?
Union-Find is a data structure that maintains a collection of disjoint sets. Each set has a representative element, and the structure supports two main operations: finding which set an element belongs to, and uniting two sets. It's fundamental to many algorithms including Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm.

## Core Operations

### Make-Set
- **Purpose**: Create a new set containing a single element
- **Process**: Initialize element as its own representative
- **Complexity**: O(1) time complexity
- **Initialization**: Each element starts in its own set

### Find
- **Purpose**: Determine which set an element belongs to
- **Process**: Follow parent pointers to find representative
- **Path Compression**: Optimize future find operations
- **Complexity**: Amortized O(α(n)) where α is inverse Ackermann function

### Union
- **Purpose**: Merge two sets into a single set
- **Process**: Make one representative point to the other
- **Union by Rank**: Optimize tree height for better performance
- **Complexity**: Amortized O(α(n)) with path compression and union by rank

## Implementation Details

### Basic Structure
```gdscript
class UnionFind:
    var parent: Array
    var rank: Array
    var count: int
    
    func _init(size: int):
        parent = []
        rank = []
        parent.resize(size)
        rank.resize(size)
        count = size
        
        # Initialize each element as its own set
        for i in range(size):
            parent[i] = i
            rank[i] = 0
```

### Key Methods
- **MakeSet**: Create new set for element
- **Find**: Find representative of element's set
- **Union**: Merge two sets
- **Connected**: Check if two elements are in same set
- **Count**: Get number of disjoint sets

## Optimization Techniques

### Path Compression
- **Purpose**: Flatten tree structure during find operations
- **Process**: Make all nodes on find path point directly to root
- **Benefit**: Significantly improves future find operations
- **Implementation**: Update parent pointers during find

### Union by Rank
- **Purpose**: Keep trees balanced for better performance
- **Process**: Attach smaller tree to root of larger tree
- **Benefit**: Prevents degenerate tree structures
- **Alternative**: Union by size (attach smaller to larger)

### Union by Size
- **Purpose**: Alternative to union by rank
- **Process**: Track size of each set, attach smaller to larger
- **Benefit**: Similar performance to union by rank
- **Consideration**: Slightly more memory overhead

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
- **MakeSet**: O(1) constant time
- **Find**: O(α(n)) amortized with optimizations
- **Union**: O(α(n)) amortized with optimizations
- **Connected**: O(α(n)) amortized (uses Find)
- **Count**: O(1) constant time

### Space Complexity
- **Storage**: O(n) for n elements
- **Overhead**: Minimal per-element storage
- **Arrays**: Parent and rank arrays
- **Efficiency**: Very memory-efficient structure
