# Graph Structures

## Overview
Graphs are fundamental data structures that represent relationships between objects through nodes (vertices) and edges. They are essential for modeling complex networks, social relationships, transportation systems, and many other real-world scenarios.

## What are Graphs?
A graph is a collection of vertices (nodes) connected by edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and can contain cycles or be acyclic. They provide a powerful abstraction for representing interconnected data.

## Basic Components

### Vertices (Nodes)
- **Data Storage**: Store information about each entity
- **Properties**: Can have attributes like weight, color, or metadata
- **Identification**: Unique identifier for each vertex
- **Degree**: Number of edges connected to the vertex

### Edges
- **Connections**: Link vertices together
- **Direction**: Directed or undirected
- **Weight**: Numerical value representing cost, distance, or strength
- **Properties**: Can have attributes like capacity, flow, or type

### Graph Types
- **Undirected**: Edges have no direction
- **Directed**: Edges have direction (digraph)
- **Weighted**: Edges have numerical weights
- **Unweighted**: All edges have equal weight

## Representation Methods

### Adjacency Matrix
- **Structure**: 2D array where A[i][j] represents edge from i to j
- **Advantages**: Fast edge lookup, simple implementation
- **Disadvantages**: O(V²) space, sparse graphs waste memory
- **Best For**: Dense graphs, frequent edge queries

### Adjacency List
- **Structure**: Array of lists, each list contains adjacent vertices
- **Advantages**: Space efficient, fast iteration over neighbors
- **Disadvantages**: Slower edge lookup, more complex deletion
- **Best For**: Sparse graphs, graph traversal

### Incidence Matrix
- **Structure**: Matrix where rows are vertices, columns are edges
- **Advantages**: Easy to find edge-vertex relationships
- **Disadvantages**: Less common, more complex operations
- **Best For**: Incidence analysis, specialized applications

## Common Graph Types

### Simple Graphs
- **No Self-loops**: Vertices don't connect to themselves
- **No Multiple Edges**: At most one edge between any two vertices
- **Undirected**: Basic undirected graph structure
- **Applications**: Social networks, road maps

### Directed Graphs (Digraphs)
- **Directional Edges**: Edges have specific direction
- **Asymmetric Relationships**: A→B doesn't imply B→A
- **Applications**: Dependency graphs, web links, food chains

### Weighted Graphs
- **Edge Weights**: Numerical values on edges
- **Cost Functions**: Represent distance, time, or capacity
- **Applications**: Navigation systems, network optimization

### Specialized Graphs
- **Trees**: Connected acyclic graphs
- **Bipartite**: Vertices divided into two independent sets
- **Planar**: Can be drawn without edge crossings
- **Complete**: Every vertex connects to every other

## Graph Operations

### Traversal Algorithms
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explore deep paths first
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explore level by level
- **Topological Sort**: Order vertices in directed acyclic graphs
- **Cycle Detection**: Find cycles in graphs

### Path Finding
- **Shortest Path**: Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford algorithms
- **All-Pairs Shortest Path**: Floyd-Warshall algorithm
- **Path Existence**: Check if path exists between vertices
- **Path Counting**: Count different paths between vertices

### Connectivity
- **Connected Components**: Find groups of connected vertices
- **Strongly Connected**: All vertices reachable from each other
- **Articulation Points**: Vertices whose removal disconnects graph
- **Bridges**: Edges whose removal disconnects graph

## Implementation Considerations

### Memory Management
