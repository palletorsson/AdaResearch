# Heap Operations

## Overview
Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property. They are commonly used to implement priority queues and provide efficient access to the maximum or minimum element. Heaps are fundamental to many algorithms including heapsort and graph algorithms.

## What are Heaps?
A heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, each parent node is greater than or equal to its children. In a min heap, each parent node is less than or equal to its children. This structure enables efficient extraction of extremal elements.

## Heap Properties

### Structural Property
- **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are filled except possibly the last
- **Array Representation**: Can be stored efficiently in an array
- **Index Relationships**: Parent at i, children at 2i+1 and 2i+2
- **Height**: O(log n) for n elements

### Heap Property
- **Max Heap**: Parent ≥ children (root is maximum)
- **Min Heap**: Parent ≤ children (root is minimum)
- **Recursive**: Property holds for all subtrees
- **Maintained**: Operations preserve heap property

## Types of Heaps

### Binary Heaps
- **Structure**: Complete binary tree
- **Types**: Max heap and min heap
- **Operations**: Insert, extract, heapify
- **Applications**: Priority queues, heapsort

### Fibonacci Heaps
- **Structure**: Collection of trees
- **Operations**: Amortized O(1) insert and decrease-key
- **Complexity**: O(log n) delete-min
- **Applications**: Advanced graph algorithms

### Binomial Heaps
- **Structure**: Collection of binomial trees
- **Operations**: Efficient merge operations
- **Complexity**: O(log n) for most operations
- **Applications**: Priority queue implementations

### Pairing Heaps
- **Structure**: Self-adjusting heap
- **Operations**: Simple but efficient
- **Complexity**: Amortized O(log n)
- **Applications**: Experimental priority queues

## Core Operations

### Insertion
- **Process**: Add element to end, bubble up
- **Bubble Up**: Compare with parent, swap if needed
- **Complexity**: O(log n) worst case
- **Maintenance**: Preserves heap property

### Extraction
- **Max/Min**: Remove root element
- **Replacement**: Move last element to root
- **Bubble Down**: Compare with children, swap if needed
- **Complexity**: O(log n) worst case

### Heapify
- **Bottom-Up**: Start from last non-leaf node
- **Bubble Down**: Ensure heap property at each level
- **Complexity**: O(n) for entire array
- **Efficiency**: More efficient than repeated insertions

## Implementation Details

### Array Representation
```gdscript
class Heap:
    var data: Array
    var heap_type: String  # "max" or "min"
    
    func _init(type: String = "max"):
        data = []
        heap_type = type
    
    func parent_index(i: int) -> int:
        return (i - 1) // 2
    
    func left_child_index(i: int) -> int:
        return 2 * i + 1
    
    func right_child_index(i: int) -> int:
        return 2 * i + 2
```

### Key Methods
- **Insert**: Add element and maintain heap property
- **Extract**: Remove and return extremal element
- **Peek**: View extremal element without removal
- **Heapify**: Convert array to heap structure

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity
- **Insertion**: O(log n) worst case
- **Extraction**: O(log n) worst case
- **Peek**: O(1) constant time

- **Delete**: O(log n) for arbitrary element

### Space Complexity
- **Storage**: O(n) for n elements
- **Overhead**: Minimal per-element storage

- **Cache Locality**: Good memory access patterns

## Applications

### Priority Queues
- **Task Scheduling**: Process highest priority tasks first
- **Event Systems**: Handle events in chronological order

- **Simulation**: Process events in correct sequence

### Sorting
- **Heapsort**: In-place sorting algorithm
- **Partial Sorting**: Find k largest/smallest elements
- **External Sorting**: Handle data too large for memory
- **Stable Sorting**: Maintain relative order of equal elements
