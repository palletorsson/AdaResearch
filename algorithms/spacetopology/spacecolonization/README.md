# Space Colonization

## Overview
This algorithm implements space colonization, a technique for generating organic, tree-like structures by simulating how organisms colonize available space, creating natural-looking branching patterns.

## Description
Space colonization works by placing attraction points in 3D space and having nodes grow toward these points, creating branching structures that naturally fill the available space. This technique is particularly effective for generating realistic trees, coral, and other organic branching structures.
