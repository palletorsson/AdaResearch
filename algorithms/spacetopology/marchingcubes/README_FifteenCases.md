# Marching Cubes: 15 Surface Cases Demo

## Overview

This demo visualizes the 15 fundamental surface cases that can occur in the Marching Cubes algorithm. Each case represents a unique surface topology configuration when a cube is intersected by an isosurface.

## Files

- `fifteen_cases_demo.tscn` - The main scene file
- `FifteenCasesController.gd` - Controller script that generates the visualizations
- `README_FifteenCases.md` - This documentation file

## The 15 Cases

1. **Case 0: Empty** - All vertices outside surface (no triangles)
2. **Case 1: Single Corner** - One vertex inside surface 
3. **Case 2: Adjacent Corners** - Two adjacent vertices inside
4. **Case 3: Triangle Corner** - Three vertices forming triangle
5. **Case 4: Diagonal Corners** - Two opposite corners
6. **Case 5: L-Shape** - Four vertices in L-shape (bottom face)
7. **Case 6: Wedge** - Triangular wedge shape
8. **Case 7: Tunnel** - Tube/tunnel through cube
9. **Case 8: Saddle** - Saddle point configuration
10. **Case 9: Complex Saddle** - Complex saddle surface
11. **Case 10: Bridge** - Bridge connecting surfaces
12. **Case 11: Complex Surface** - Complex multi-surface
13. **Case 12: Asymmetric** - Asymmetric surface pattern
14. **Case 13: Nearly Full** - Seven vertices inside
15. **Case 14: Full** - All vertices inside surface (no triangles)

## Controls

- **W** - Toggle wireframes on/off
- **L** - Toggle labels on/off
- **A** - Toggle animation (breathing effect)
- **R** - Regenerate all cases

## Visual Legend

- **Red spheres** - Vertices inside the isosurface (density > 0.5)
- **Blue spheres** - Vertices outside the isosurface (density < 0.5)  
- **White lines** - Cube edges showing the voxel structure
- **Colored surfaces** - The actual triangulated surface generated by marching cubes

## Understanding the Cases

Each case shows:
1. The **wireframe cube** with colored vertex indicators
2. The **generated surface mesh** in a unique color
3. **Labels** describing the case type and configuration index

The configuration index is the 8-bit value (0-255) that represents which of the cube's 8 vertices are inside the surface. These 256 possible configurations reduce to just 15 unique cases when accounting for symmetry and rotations.

## Technical Details

- Uses the existing `MarchingCubesGenerator` class
- Demonstrates proper vertex interpolation
- Shows edge intersection calculations
- Includes surface normal generation
- Validates triangle generation for each case

## Educational Value

This demo helps understand:
- How marching cubes reduces complex 3D surfaces to simple cases
- The relationship between vertex density values and surface generation
- How different vertex configurations create different surface topologies
- The symmetry inherent in the marching cubes algorithm

## Usage

1. Open `fifteen_cases_demo.tscn` in Godot
2. Run the scene to see all 15 cases displayed in a 3x5 grid
3. Use the controls to explore different visualization modes
4. Study how each vertex configuration generates its unique surface

Perfect for learning computer graphics, procedural generation, and understanding how voxel-based terrain systems work!
