# Network Flow Visualization

## üåä Flow Distribution & Capacity Politics

A comprehensive implementation of Network Flow algorithms including Ford-Fulkerson method, Edmonds-Karp algorithm, and maximum flow computation with real-time visualization of flow distribution, capacity constraints, and minimum cut identification. This algorithm explores resource distribution politics and bottleneck analysis in network systems.

## üéØ Algorithm Overview

Network Flow algorithms solve the maximum flow problem: finding the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a source to a sink in a flow network, subject to capacity constraints on edges. The algorithms also identify minimum cuts that separate source from sink.

### Key Concepts

1. **Flow Network**: Directed graph with capacity constraints on edges
2. **Source and Sink**: Starting and ending nodes for flow
3. **Capacity**: Maximum flow allowed through each edge
4. **Residual Graph**: Network showing remaining capacity after current flow
5. **Augmenting Path**: Path from source to sink with positive residual capacity
6. **Maximum Flow**: Largest possible flow from source to sink
7. **Minimum Cut**: Smallest capacity cut separating source from sink

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithm Features

- **Multiple Algorithms**: Ford-Fulkerson (DFS), Edmonds-Karp (BFS), Dinic's algorithm
- **3D Graph Visualization**: Interactive network with nodes, edges, and flow indicators
- **Flow Animation**: Real-time visualization of augmenting path discovery
- **Capacity Management**: Dynamic edge capacity editing and visualization
- **Cut Identification**: Automatic minimum cut detection and highlighting

### Ford-Fulkerson Method

#### Algorithm Steps
```
1. Initialize flow to 0
2. While there exists an augmenting path from source to sink:
   a. Find augmenting path using DFS
   b. Determine bottleneck capacity along path
   c. Augment flow along path by bottleneck amount
   d. Update residual graph
3. Return maximum flow
```

#### Time Complexity
- **Ford-Fulkerson**: O(max_flow √ó E) where E is number of edges
- **Edmonds-Karp**: O(V √ó E¬≤) where V is number of vertices
- **Space Complexity**: O(V¬≤) for adjacency matrix representation

### Edmonds-Karp Algorithm

Enhanced version of Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find shortest augmenting paths, guaranteeing polynomial time complexity.

### Maximum Flow = Minimum Cut Theorem

The maximum flow value equals the capacity of the minimum cut, providing dual optimization perspectives on network capacity.

## üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Flow Distribution Framework

### Capacity Politics
Network Flow algorithms embody questions about resource distribution and access:

- **Who controls the flow?** Source and sink privileges in network design
