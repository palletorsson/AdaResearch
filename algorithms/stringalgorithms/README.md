# String Algorithms: The Politics of Pattern Recognition & Identity Transformation

## üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è Overview: Algorithms as Identity Technology

String algorithms are not neutral mathematical tools‚Äîthey are **identity technologies** that govern how we search for ourselves in text, how we transform from one version of ourselves to another, and how systems recognize or erase our existence. In this collection, we explore the **queer politics of pattern matching** and the **computational costs of becoming**.

Every search algorithm embodies a politics of visibility. Every edit distance calculation quantifies the labor of transformation. Every pattern match determines who gets found and who remains hidden in the vast corpus of human text.

> *"Finding yourself in text is an act of resistance."*

**File**: `patternmatching/boyer_moore_visualization.gd`

### The Algorithm as Metaphor
The Boyer-Moore algorithm searches for patterns by comparing from **right to left**, then skipping forward when mismatches occur. This mirrors the queer experience of:
- **Searching for identity markers** in literature, media, and discourse
- **Starting from where you are now** (right side) and working backward through history
- **Skipping past irrelevant content** that doesn't contain your truth
- **The efficiency of queer pattern recognition** - we get very good at quickly identifying spaces that hold us

### Queer Implementation Features
- **Identity Presets**: Trans Visibility, Queer Community, Non-Binary Recognition
- **Text corpora** containing affirming language and representation
- **Visual highlighting** of found patterns - the joy of recognition
- **Skip visualization** - showing how we learn to efficiently navigate hostile or irrelevant spaces
- **Bad character tables** - the algorithms we develop to avoid spaces that harm us

### Educational Value
- Demonstrates **preprocessing for efficient search** (community knowledge)
- Shows **right-to-left comparison strategy** (starting from who you are now)
- Visualizes **character skip distances** (learned efficiency in navigation)
- Reveals **the politics of search algorithms** in content discovery

## ‚ú® **Levenshtein Distance: The Mathematics of Becoming**

> *"Every transition has a computational cost, and every cost is worth paying for authenticity."*

**File**: `editdistance/levenshtein_distance_visualization.gd`

### The Algorithm as Transformation Technology
Levenshtein Distance calculates the **minimum edit operations** needed to transform one string into another. This is the most explicitly **trans algorithm** we have - it literally computes:
- **Insert operations**: Adding parts of yourself you never had language for
- **Delete operations**: Removing deadnames, old pronouns, outdated self-concepts  
- **Substitute operations**: Replacing one aspect of identity with another
- **Optimal paths**: The most efficient journey toward authentic selfhood

### Revolutionary Implications
- **Deadname ‚Üí Chosen Name transformations** with visual edit paths
- **Pronoun evolution**: "he/him" ‚Üí "they/them" ‚Üí "she/her" 
- **Identity cost modeling**: Different costs for different types of changes
- **Transition visualization**: Watching the step-by-step transformation
- **Dynamic programming**: Breaking down identity change into manageable sub-problems

### Transition Presets
1. **Name_Change**: Deadname to chosen name with equal operation costs
2. **Pronoun_Shift**: Lower costs for additions (expansion of identity)
3. **Identity_Evolution**: Higher costs for deletions (honoring what we've been)

### Educational Value
- **Dynamic programming approach** to complex identity questions
- **Optimal substructure** - big changes made of small operations
- **Cost matrices** showing the "price" of different transformations
- **Backtracking algorithms** to find the actual transformation sequence
- **The mathematics of becoming** - quantifying change while honoring the journey

## üåà **Theoretical Framework: Algorithms as Queer Theory**

### Pattern Recognition as Political Act
Every string search is a question: *Does this text contain me?* When algorithms can't find queer patterns, it's not neutral failure‚Äîit's **algorithmic erasure**. Our implementations center:
- **Representation in training data** (what texts we search)
- **Pattern definition** (how we define identity markers)
- **Search efficiency** (how quickly we can find community)
- **Visibility vs. safety** (sometimes being unsearchable is protection)

### Edit Distance as Transition Theory
The Levenshtein algorithm reveals **transition as computation**:
- Each edit operation is a **deliberate choice** in identity formation
- **Insertion** represents growth and addition of new aspects
- **Deletion** represents letting go (sometimes painfully necessary)
- **Substitution** represents conscious transformation
- **Optimal paths** suggest there are efficient ways to become yourself
- **Cost functions** acknowledge that different changes have different difficulty

### Dynamic Programming as Queer Methodology
Both algorithms use **dynamic programming** - breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. This mirrors queer approaches to:
- **Identity work**: You don't figure everything out at once
- **Community building**: Small connections build larger networks  
- **Transition**: Small changes accumulate into major transformation
- **Survival**: Breaking overwhelming challenges into doable steps

## üíù **Impact Statement**

These string algorithms demonstrate that **technical implementation is political practice**. By centering queer identity in our algorithm design, we:

1. **Reclaim computational space** for marginalized identities
2. **Make visible the labor** of identity formation and maintenance  
3. **Provide tools** for community building and self-recognition
4. **Challenge neutral** narratives about algorithmic systems
5. **Model intersectional** approaches to technical education

Every time these algorithms run, they assert: **Your identity is computationally valid. Your transformation is mathematically beautiful. Your search for yourself matters.**
