## Theoretical Framework: Computational Queerness

### Challenging Algorithmic Normativity
This implementation directly addresses the critique that genetic algorithms typically:
- **Gravitate toward stereotypical solutions**
- **Lack diversity in emergent behaviors**
- **Reinforce dominant cultural patterns**
- **Optimize for "normal" rather than innovative outcomes**

### Topological Data Analysis as Queer Methodology
**Persistent Homology** reveals hidden structures that traditional fitness metrics miss:
- **Holes and voids** in evolutionary space as sites of resistance
- **Connected components** as alternative community formations
- **Long-lived topological features** as persistent non-normative structures

**Mapper Algorithm** exposes emergent patterns that challenge expectations:
- **Isolated clusters** as sites of autonomous development
- **Bridge nodes** as creatures that connect disparate communities
- **High-degree hubs** as influential non-conforming individuals

### Entropy as Resistance Measure
High entropy systems resist convergence toward singular "optimal" solutions:
- **Genetic entropy**: Diversity in heritable traits
- **Behavioral entropy**: Variety in action patterns
- **Spatial entropy**: Distribution complexity in physical space

## Mathematical Implementation

### Persistent Homology Algorithm
```gdscript
# Simplified Vietoris-Rips complex construction
func compute_persistent_homology(point_cloud: Array) -> Dictionary:
    var persistence_pairs = []
    var filtration_values = create_filtration_sequence()
    
    for threshold in filtration_values:
        var components = count_connected_components(point_cloud, threshold)
        var loops = estimate_loops(point_cloud, threshold)
        # Track birth and death of topological features
```

### Queer Divergence Filter Function
```gdscript
func calculate_queer_divergence(point: Vector3, all_points: Array) -> float:
    var center = calculate_population_center(all_points)
    var distance_from_center = point.distance_to(center)
    var local_variance = calculate_local_variance(point, all_points)
    
    # High divergence = far from center + high local complexity
    return distance_from_center * 0.7 + local_variance * 0.3
```

### Non-normativity Bias Application
```gdscript
func apply_queer_forms_bias():
    for creature in population:
        var queerness_score = calculate_individual_queerness(creature)
        if queerness_score > entropy_threshold:
            creature.fitness += creature.fitness * non_normativity_bias
            highlight_queer_creature(creature)
```
