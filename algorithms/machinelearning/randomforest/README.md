# Random Forest Visualization

## 🌲 Collective Intelligence & Democratic Decision Making

A comprehensive implementation of Random Forest ensemble learning with 3D visualization of individual decision trees, bootstrap sampling, and democratic voting mechanisms. This algorithm explores collective decision-making processes through multiple decision trees working together.

## 🎯 Algorithm Overview

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a more robust and accurate classifier. It uses bootstrap sampling to create diverse training sets for each tree and employs majority voting for final predictions, embodying democratic principles in machine learning.

### Key Concepts

1. **Ensemble Learning**: Combining multiple weak learners to create a strong learner
2. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Random sampling with replacement to create diverse training sets
3. **Feature Randomness**: Random subset of features considered at each split
4. **Majority Voting**: Democratic decision-making through tree consensus

## 🏳️‍🌈 Democratic Algorithm Framework

### Collective Decision Making
Random Forest embodies democratic principles through:

1. **Diverse Perspectives**: Each tree sees different training data
2. **Equal Voting Rights**: All trees have equal say in final prediction
3. **Majority Rule**: Final decision based on majority vote
4. **Minority Protection**: Outlier trees can still influence decisions

### Algorithmic Democracy Questions
- **Who gets to vote?** All trees participate equally
- **How are representatives chosen?** Random bootstrap sampling
- **What about dissenting voices?** Minority tree predictions are recorded
- **Can the majority be wrong?** Ensemble can still make errors
