# Support Vector Machine Visualization

## üß† Mathematical Justice & Boundary Politics

A comprehensive implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) with real-time visualization of classification boundaries, support vectors, and kernel transformations. This algorithm explores the politics of classification boundaries and demonstrates how mathematical optimization creates separating hyperplanes in high-dimensional identity spaces.

## üéØ Algorithm Overview

Support Vector Machines are powerful supervised learning algorithms that find the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes in high-dimensional space. The algorithm maximizes the margin between classes while minimizing classification errors, creating a decision boundary that is robust to outliers.

### Key Concepts

1. **Hyperplane**: A decision boundary that separates different classes
2. **Support Vectors**: The critical data points that define the hyperplane
3. **Margin**: The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points
4. **Kernel Trick**: Mapping data to higher dimensions for non-linear separation

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithm Features

- **Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO)**: Efficient quadratic programming solver
- **Multiple Kernel Support**: Linear, Polynomial, RBF, and Sigmoid kernels
- **Real-time Visualization**: Step-by-step optimization process
- **Interactive Parameters**: Dynamic adjustment of C, gamma, and kernel parameters

### Kernel Functions

1. **Linear Kernel**: `K(x,y) = x¬∑y`
   - Best for linearly separable data
   - Fastest computation

2. **Polynomial Kernel**: `K(x,y) = (Œ≥x¬∑y + 1)^d`
   - Captures polynomial relationships
   - Degree parameter controls complexity

3. **RBF Kernel**: `K(x,y) = exp(-Œ≥||x-y||¬≤)`
   - Most popular for non-linear data
   - Gamma controls width of influence

4. **Sigmoid Kernel**: `K(x,y) = tanh(Œ≥x¬∑y + 1)`
   - Neural network-like behavior
   - Can be unstable in some cases

## üéÆ Interactive Controls

### Basic Controls
- **SPACE**: Start/Stop training process
- **R**: Reset data and regenerate samples
- **1-4**: Switch between kernel types
- **‚Üë/‚Üì**: Adjust C parameter (regularization)

### Parameters
- **C Parameter**: Controls regularization (higher = stricter classification)
- **Gamma**: Kernel coefficient (higher = more complex boundaries)
- **Degree**: Polynomial degree (for polynomial kernel)
- **Tolerance**: Numerical precision for convergence

### Boundary Politics
SVMs create mathematical boundaries that separate categories - a process that mirrors how society creates boundaries around identity categories. The algorithm raises critical questions:

- **Who decides the boundaries?** The training data reflects historical biases
- **What gets lost in the margins?** Points near the boundary face classification uncertainty
- **How do we handle non-conforming data?** Support vectors define the limits of categories

### Algorithmic Justice Framework
1. **Hyperplane as Social Boundary**: Mathematical boundaries reflect social categorization
2. **Support Vectors as Boundary Cases**: Critical points that define the limits of categories
3. **Kernel Tricks as Dimensional Expansion**: How algorithms create new spaces for separation
4. **Margin Maximization as Safety Distance**: The politics of maintaining categorical distance
