# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Overview
This algorithm demonstrates Generative Adversarial Networks, a powerful framework for training generative models through an adversarial process where two neural networks compete: a generator that creates data and a discriminator that evaluates authenticity.

## What It Does
- **Data Generation**: Creates realistic, high-quality data samples
- **Adversarial Training**: Two networks competing and improving together
- **Generator Network**: Produces synthetic data samples
- **Discriminator Network**: Distinguishes real from fake data
