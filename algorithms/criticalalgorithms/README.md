# Critical Algorithms

This directory contains 3D visualizations that examine the societal, ethical, and political implications of algorithmic systems. These visualizations explore how algorithms impact society and raise awareness about algorithmic bias, surveillance, and digital power structures.

## Algorithms Included

### Algorithmic Bias
- **Algorithmic Bias** (`algorithmic_bias/`) - Demonstrating bias in machine learning systems
- **Algorithmic Bias Visualization** (`algorithmic_bias_visualization/`) - Interactive bias detection and mitigation

### Ethics and AI
- **Ethics in AI** (`ethics_in_AI/`) - Ethical frameworks and decision-making in AI systems

## Critical Perspectives

### Bias and Fairness
- **Data Bias**: How training data reflects societal prejudices
- **Algorithmic Discrimination**: Unfair treatment based on protected characteristics
- **Feedback Loops**: How biased outputs reinforce existing inequalities
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Techniques for reducing algorithmic bias

### Surveillance and Privacy
- **Surveillance Systems**: Monitoring and tracking technologies
- **Data Collection**: How personal information is gathered and used
- **Privacy Erosion**: The gradual loss of digital privacy
- **Resistance Strategies**: Tools and techniques for protecting privacy

### Power and Control
- **Algorithmic Authority**: How algorithms shape decision-making
- **Digital Divide**: Unequal access to algorithmic benefits
- **Automation Impact**: Effects on employment and social structures
- **Democratic Participation**: Algorithms' role in political processes

## Educational Objectives

## VR Experience

Immersive critical engagement:
- **Perspective Shifting**: Experience algorithms from different viewpoints
- **Scale Navigation**: Move between individual and systemic levels
- **Scenario Exploration**: Interact with different algorithmic configurations
- **Collective Reflection**: Shared spaces for discussing algorithmic impact

## Implementation Notes

### Ethical Considerations
- Avoid reproducing harmful stereotypes in visualizations
- Center marginalized perspectives and experiences
- Provide content warnings for sensitive topics
- Include resources for further learning and action

### Critical Engagement
- Encourage questioning rather than passive consumption
- Provide multiple perspectives on controversial topics
- Connect technical concepts to lived experiences
- Support informed participation in technology governance

These visualizations aim to democratize algorithmic literacy and empower users to critically engage with the technological systems that shape our world.
