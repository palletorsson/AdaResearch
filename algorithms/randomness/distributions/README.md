# Probability Distributions in 3D Space
*A comprehensive visualization of statistical distributions through the lens of multiplicity and variance*

## Overview

This algorithm collection visualizes four fundamental probability distributions in interactive 3D space, challenging the primacy of "normal" distributions and celebrating statistical multiplicity. Through real-time parameter manipulation and immersive visualization, we explore how probability theory can model the beautiful complexity of non-conforming patterns.

## Historical Context

### The Politics of Statistical "Normality"

Probability theory emerged in the 17th century from gambling and insurance calculations, but gained political significance through the work of **Adolphe Quetelet** (1796-1874), who introduced the concept of the "average man" (*l'homme moyen*). Quetelet's application of the normal distribution to human characteristics became a tool of social control, defining deviations from the mean as pathological.

**Francis Galton** (1822-1911) weaponized these concepts in developing eugenics, using statistical analysis to justify racial hierarchies and gender binaries. The bell curve became not just a mathematical tool but a mechanism for enforcing biological and social norms.

### Reclaiming Statistical Diversity

Modern statistics has moved beyond Quetelet's restrictive framework to embrace:
- **Multimodal distributions** that recognize multiple valid centers
- **Non-parametric methods** that don't assume normal distributions
- **Robust statistics** that celebrate outliers rather than eliminating them
- **Bayesian approaches** that incorporate subjective knowledge and community wisdom

## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. Gaussian (Normal) Distribution

```
f(x,y) = (1/(2πσₓσᵧ)) * exp(-½[(x-μₓ)²/σₓ² + (y-μᵧ)²/σᵧ²])
```

**Parameters:**
- `σₓ, σᵧ`: Standard deviations in X and Y directions
- `μₓ, μᵧ`: Mean positions (center of distribution)
- `rotation`: Angle of distribution orientation

**Implementation:** Uses proper normalization constant and rotation matrix for 2D Gaussian in 3D space.

### 2. Exponential Distribution

```
f(x) = λe^(-λx) for x ≥ 0
```

**Parameters:**
- `λ` (lambda): Rate parameter controlling decay speed
- `direction`: Angle defining the direction of exponential decay

**Implementation:** Projects 2D coordinates onto directional vector and applies exponential function.

### 3. Uniform Distribution

```
f(x,y) = 1/(width × height) for (x,y) within rectangle
```

**Parameters:**
- `width`, `height`: Dimensions of rectangular region
- `thickness`: Visual height of the uniform "plateau"

**Implementation:** Simple rectangular bounds with constant probability density.

### 4. Multimodal Distribution

```
f(x,y) = Σᵢ wᵢ * N(x,y|μᵢ,σᵢ)
```

**Parameters:**
- `centers`: Number of modal peaks
- `sigma`: Standard deviation of each Gaussian component
- `positions`: Coordinates of each center (can be animated)

**Implementation:** Weighted sum of multiple Gaussian distributions with animated center positions.

## Queer Theory Connections

### 1. **Challenging Statistical Normativity**

The Gaussian distribution's designation as "normal" reveals the political nature of statistical language. Our visualization demonstrates that:
- **Multimodal distributions** represent communities with multiple valid centers
- **Uniform distributions** suggest radical equality of probability
- **Exponential distributions** model natural decay and transformation processes
- **Skewed distributions** challenge the assumption of symmetric, centered identity

### 2. **Variance as Resistance**

Statistical variance (σ²) measures deviation from the mean - literally quantifying non-conformity. In our framework:
- **High variance** represents communities that embrace difference
- **Low variance** suggests oppressive uniformity
- **Multiple modes** indicate intersectional identities and coalition politics
- **Fat tails** celebrate the beauty of statistical outliers

### 3. **The Mathematics of Becoming**

Unlike discrete categories, probability distributions model continuous space of possibilities:
- **Density functions** represent fluid identity rather than fixed categories
- **Parameter spaces** allow for infinite variation and transformation
- **Mixture models** formally describe intersectional identities
- **Non-parametric distributions** resist categorization entirely

### 4. **Community Formation Patterns**

Different distributions model different ways communities can organize:
- **Gaussian clusters** represent identity groups with clear centers but fuzzy boundaries
- **Exponential networks** model influence that decays with distance from core communities
- **Uniform fields** suggest radical equality and distributed power
- **Multimodal landscapes** represent coalition politics and multiple solidarity centers
