- `InstancingScatterVR.tscn` - Scene file  
- `README.md` - This file

### What This Creates:
🌸 **5000+ scattered objects** across a procedural terrain surface
💎 **Glowing crystals** - Growing from the surface with emission materials  
🌺 **Colorful flowers** - Randomized petal colors and gentle swaying
✨ **Floating particles** - Glowing orbs that drift and pulse above the ground
🏔️ **Organic terrain** - Perlin noise-based landscape for natural scattering

### How to Use:

1. **Copy to your Godot project:**
   - Copy `InstancingScatterVR.gd` and `InstancingScatterVR.tscn` to your project

2. **Add to your VR scene:**
   - Add `InstancingScatterVR.tscn` as a child node to your VR world
   - Position and scale as needed for your environment

3. **Customize in Inspector:**
   - `instance_count`: Total number of scattered objects (default: 5000)
   - `scatter_radius`: Size of the scattered area (default: 20.0)
   - `animation_speed`: Speed of swaying/floating animations (default: 1.0)
   - `object_scale`: Overall scale of scattered objects (default: 0.3)

### VR Experience:
🚶 **Walk through crystal gardens** - Thousands of glowing crystals
🦋 **Explore flower fields** - Colorful procedural flowers swaying gently  
⭐ **Watch floating lights** - Magical particles drifting overhead
🎨 **Dynamic colors** - Each object has randomized materials
🌊 **Smooth performance** - Uses MultiMesh for efficient rendering

### Performance Notes:
- Optimized for VR with MultiMeshInstance3D
- 5000 instances render efficiently as single draw calls
- Gentle animations won't cause motion sickness
- Scales well - reduce instance_count if needed for performance

Perfect for creating magical VR environments like enchanted forests, alien worlds, or crystal caves!
