## Vector Fundamentals

### What is a Vector?
- **Definition**: A quantity with both magnitude (size) and direction
- **Representation**: Arrow from origin to endpoint
- **Components**: v = (vₓ, vᵧ, vᵤ) in 3D space
- **Examples**: Velocity, force, displacement, acceleration

### Vector Components
- **X-Component**: Projection onto x-axis (red)
- **Y-Component**: Projection onto y-axis (green)  
- **Z-Component**: Projection onto z-axis (blue)
- **Geometric**: Components form a rectangular box to vector endpoint

### Magnitude (Length)
- **Formula**: |v| = √(vₓ² + vᵧ² + vᵤ²)
- **Geometric**: Distance from origin to endpoint
- **Properties**: Always non-negative, zero only for zero vector
- **Units**: Same as vector components

### Unit Vector
- **Definition**: Vector with magnitude exactly 1
- **Formula**: û = v/|v| (for non-zero vectors)
- **Purpose**: Represents pure direction without magnitude
- **Properties**: Points in same direction as original vector

### Direction Angles
- **Alpha (α)**: Angle with positive x-axis
- **Beta (β)**: Angle with positive y-axis
- **Gamma (γ)**: Angle with positive z-axis
- **Formula**: cos(α) = vₓ/|v|, etc.

## Visual Elements
- **Main Vector**: White arrow showing complete vector
- **X-Component**: Red arrow along x-axis
- **Y-Component**: Green arrow along y-axis
- **Z-Component**: Blue arrow along z-axis
- **Component Box**: Wireframe showing 3D decomposition
- **Unit Vector**: Magenta arrow showing normalized direction
- **Coordinate Grid**: 3D grid with labeled axes

## Mathematical Relationships

### Pythagorean Theorem (3D)
```
|v|² = vₓ² + vᵧ² + vᵤ²
```

### Unit Vector Calculation
```
û = v/|v| = (vₓ/|v|, vᵧ/|v|, vᵤ/|v|)
```

### Direction Cosines
```
cos(α) = vₓ/|v|
cos(β) = vᵧ/|v|  
cos(γ) = vᵤ/|v|
```

### Identity
```
cos²(α) + cos²(β) + cos²(γ) = 1
```

## Key Insights
- **Vector vs Scalar**: Vectors have direction; scalars have only magnitude
- **Component Independence**: Each component contributes independently to magnitude
- **Normalization**: Any non-zero vector can be made unit length
- **3D Geometry**: Components form a rectangular parallelepiped
- **Direction Preservation**: Unit vectors preserve direction while standardizing magnitude

## Interactive Learning
- **Experiment with different vector directions and observe component changes**
- **Create vectors along coordinate axes to understand pure components**
- **Try zero-magnitude vectors and observe unit vector behavior**
- **Explore how direction angles change with vector orientation**
- **Build intuition for 3D spatial relationships**

## Real-World Applications
- **Physics**: Velocity, acceleration, force vectors
- **Engineering**: Structural analysis, fluid flow
- **Computer Graphics**: 3D object positioning, camera orientation
- **Navigation**: GPS coordinates, aircraft flight paths
- **Robotics**: Joint movements, end-effector positioning

## Common Misconceptions
- **Vectors ≠ Points**: Vectors represent displacement, not position
- **Free Vectors**: Vectors can be moved without changing their properties
- **Component Sign**: Negative components indicate opposite direction
- **Magnitude Always Positive**: |v| ≥ 0, with equality only for zero vector

## Extensions
- Try creating vectors with specific magnitudes
- Explore vectors in different octants of 3D space
- Compare component magnitudes to total magnitude
- Investigate relationships between similar direction vectors
- Practice estimating magnitudes visually vs calculation
