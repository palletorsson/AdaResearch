# Cross Product & Oriented Area

Scrub two interactive vectors to understand how the cross product forms a perpendicular normal and measures the parallelogram spanned by **a** and **b**.

## Highlights
- **Interactive Operands** - Drag either arrow to reshape vectors **a** and **b**.
- **Normal Arrow** - The lavender arrow renders `a x b`, updating direction and magnitude in real time.
- **Dynamic Parallelogram** - A translucent surface fills the span of **a** and **b**, matching the area `|a x b|`.
- **Analytics Panel** - Angle, sine relationship, and component readout hover nearby for quick reference.

## Learning Goals
1. Visualise the right-hand orientation of the cross product.
2. Interpret `|a x b|` as area and `sin(theta)` scaling.
3. Connect cross product magnitude/direction to torque, normals, and rotational effects.
