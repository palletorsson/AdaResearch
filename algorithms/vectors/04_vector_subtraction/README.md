# Vector Subtraction & Opposites

Discover subtraction as "adding the opposite" by manipulating two interactive vectors. Negative copies appear automatically so you can see how reversing direction isolates relative displacement.

## Highlights
- **Operant Vectors** – Adjust vectors **a** and **b** directly with VR grabs.
- **Difference Arrow** – The white arrow shows `a - b` from the origin.
- **Opposite Vector** – A semi-transparent clone renders `-b` and repositions itself at the head of **a** each frame.
- **Info Panel** – Components, magnitudes, and the constructed negative vector are reported in world space.

## Interaction Cheatsheet
- **Grab a or b** – Move endpoints to redefine the operands.
- **Observe -b** – The translucent arrow mirrors **b** across the origin.
- **Compare** – Track how the difference arrow bridges from **b** to **a** when the vectors share endpoints.

## Learning Goals
1. Understand subtraction through addition of the inverse vector.
2. Visualise displacement from **b** to **a** as the resultant.
3. Internalise how reversing a vector affects magnitude and direction.
