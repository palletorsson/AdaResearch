# Vector Field Flow Playground

Survey a swirling vector field and launch a particle to see how local vectors steer motion over time.

## Highlights
- **Field Grid** – Static arrows sample the field on a square lattice; the vectors breathe slowly to illustrate time-dependent flow.
- **Test Particle** – An orange marker advects according to the field with simple Euler integration.
- **Live Readouts** – Position, velocity, and sampled field values display on an overhead panel.
- **Quick Controls** – Press `R` to reset to the origin or `Space` to zero the velocity.

## Learning Goals
1. Interpret vector fields as maps from space to velocity directions.
2. Observe how curl- and divergence-like behaviour manifests in particle trajectories.
3. Contrast instantaneous vectors with accumulated motion over time.
