# Torque, Moment Arm & Angular Effects

Interact with the radius vector `r` and applied force `F` to explore how torque emerges from their cross product.

## Highlights
- **Radius Controller** - Drag the orange arrow to set the lever arm from the origin to the contact point.
- **Force Controller** - The cyan arrow lives at the end of `r`, directing the applied force.
- **Torque Arrow** - A lavender arrow shows `tau = r x F`, oriented perpendicular to the plane of action.
- **Moment Arm Helper** - A green arrow reveals the component of `r` perpendicular to `F`.

## Learning Goals
1. Connect torque magnitude to lever-arm and force alignment.
2. Visualise how right-hand orientation predicts rotational direction.
3. Relate the perpendicular component of `r` to mechanical advantage.
