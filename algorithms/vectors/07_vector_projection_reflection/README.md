# Projection & Reflection on a Plane

Manipulate an incident vector and a plane normal to observe projections and mirror reflections in 3D space. The plane reorients itself in real time to match the normal you define.

## Highlights
- **Incident & Normal Controllers** - Drag the orange and cyan arrows to reshape the interaction.
- **Plane Projection** - A green arrow visualises the tangential component that lies on the plane.
- **Reflection Vector** - A magenta arrow mirrors the incident direction according to the law of reflection.
- **Adaptive Plane** - The translucent plane rotates with the normal controller so you can study arbitrary orientations.

## Learning Goals
1. Decompose vectors into normal and tangential components.
2. Apply the reflection formula `r = v - 2 (v·n) n` interactively.
3. Build intuition for how surface orientation shapes reflection behaviour.
