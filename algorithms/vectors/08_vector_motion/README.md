# Motion Vectors & Kinematics

Drive a physics sphere with an acceleration controller while monitoring velocity and position vectors in real time.

## Highlights
- **Acceleration Controller** – Drag the orange arrow to apply acceleration directly to the sphere.
- **Velocity Indicator** – A cyan arrow visualises instantaneous velocity from the sphere's centre.
- **Position Vector** – A green arrow tracks displacement from the origin to the sphere.
- **Status Panel** – Magnitudes and components refresh continuously for quick quantitative checks.

## Learning Goals
1. Connect applied acceleration to changes in velocity and position.
2. Observe how vector directions shift as the sphere moves.
3. Practice kinematics vocabulary (speed, displacement, acceleration) inside an embodied environment.
