# Free Energy Principle: Interactive 3D Markov Blanket Visualization

## Overview

This project implements the first interactive 3D computational model of Karl Friston's **Free Energy Principle**, featuring dynamic Markov blankets that visualize how biological systems maintain their organization through active inference and predictive processing.

## Theoretical Background

### The Free Energy Principle

Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle proposes that all biological systems can be understood as engaging in variational Bayesian inference to minimize surprise and maintain their structural integrity. The principle suggests that life itself is fundamentally about prediction and error minimization.

### Markov Blankets

At the heart of the FEP are **Markov blankets** - statistical boundaries that partition the world into:

- **Internal states (η)**: The system's internal organization and beliefs
- **External states (ψ)**: Environmental factors beyond direct interaction  
- **Sensory states (s)**: Boundary states influenced by external states
- **Active states (a)**: Boundary states that influence external states

## Implementation Features

### 3D Visualization Components

**Inner World (Internal States)**
- Pulsating blue sphere representing internal organization
- Dynamic scaling based on confidence and prediction accuracy
- Emission properties reflecting internal entropy levels

**Membrane System (Markov Blanket)**
- Orange translucent boundary implementing sensory/active state dynamics
- Real-time deformation based on information processing
- Adaptive material properties reflecting boundary permeability

**Outer Environment (External States)**
- Green ambient field representing environmental complexity
- Information hotspots generating prediction challenges
- Spatial distribution reflecting environmental entropy

### Key Dynamics

**Information Flow Processing**
- Hotspots approach the membrane from external environment
- Contact triggers absorption and processing effects
- Successful processing updates internal entropy
- Failed predictions generate visible error signals

**Entropy Visualization**
- Real-time display of inner and outer entropy levels
- Visual feedback showing system adaptation
- Color-coded representation of confidence states

**Active Inference Mechanics**
- Selective attention: membrane preferentially processes certain information
- Predictive adaptation: repeated exposure leads to processing optimization
- Error propagation: prediction errors create cascading visual effects
