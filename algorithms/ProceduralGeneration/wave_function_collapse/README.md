# Wave Function Collapse

## Overview
This algorithm demonstrates the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) technique, a constraint-based procedural generation method that creates coherent patterns and structures by propagating constraints through a grid system.

## What It Does
- **Pattern Generation**: Creates coherent, structured patterns
- **Constraint Propagation**: Ensures pattern consistency
- **Grid-based Generation**: Builds patterns on regular grids
- **Real-time Generation**: Continuous pattern creation
- **Interactive Control**: User-adjustable generation parameters
- **Multiple Outputs**: Various pattern types and styles

## Key Concepts

### WFC Algorithm
- **Wave Function**: Superposition of possible states
- **Collapse**: Selecting a specific state for a cell
- **Propagation**: Spreading constraints to neighboring cells
- **Entropy**: Measure of uncertainty in cell states
- **Constraints**: Rules that determine valid patterns

### Generation Process
- **Initialization**: Setting up the wave function grid
- **Observation**: Collapsing cells with lowest entropy
- **Propagation**: Updating neighboring cell possibilities
- **Iteration**: Repeating until grid is complete
- **Backtracking**: Handling constraint violations

## Algorithm Features
- **Multiple Pattern Types**: Various generation styles
- **Real-time Generation**: Continuous pattern creation
- **Constraint Management**: Flexible rule definition
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks generation speed and quality
- **Parameter Control**: Adjustable generation parameters
- **Export Capabilities**: Save generated patterns and configurations

## Use Cases
- **Game Development**: Procedural level and world generation
- **Texture Generation**: Creating seamless, repeating patterns
- **Architecture**: Building and city layout generation
- **Artistic Expression**: Abstract pattern creation
- **Simulation**: Natural landscape and ecosystem generation
- **Education**: Teaching constraint satisfaction concepts

## Technical Implementation
- **GDScript**: Written in Godot's scripting language
