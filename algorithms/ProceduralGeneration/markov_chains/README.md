# Markov Chains

## Overview
This algorithm demonstrates Markov chains, stochastic processes where the probability of transitioning to a new state depends only on the current state, enabling probabilistic modeling and generation of sequences.

## What It Does
- **State Transitions**: Models probabilistic state changes
- **Sequence Generation**: Creates sequences based on transition probabilities
- **Probability Analysis**: Analyzes transition likelihoods
- **Real-time Generation**: Continuous sequence creation
- **Interactive Control**: User-adjustable parameters
- **Multiple Chain Types**: Various Markov chain variants

## Key Concepts

### Markov Properties
- **Memorylessness**: Future depends only on current state
- **Transition Matrix**: Probabilities between all state pairs
- **Stationary Distribution**: Long-term state probabilities
- **Absorbing States**: States that cannot be left
- **Irreducibility**: All states are reachable from any other

### Chain Types
- **Discrete Markov**: Finite set of discrete states
- **Continuous Markov**: Continuous state spaces
- **Hidden Markov**: States not directly observable
- **Higher-order**: Dependencies on multiple previous states
- **Time-homogeneous**: Transition probabilities don't change
