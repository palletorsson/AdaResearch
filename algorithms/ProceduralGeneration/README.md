# Procedural Generation Algorithms

Techniques for algorithmically creating content and structures without manual design.

## Algorithms Included

- **Markov Chains** (`markov_chains/`) - Sequence generation based on probabilistic transitions.
- **Voronoi Diagrams** (`voronoi_diagrams/`) - Spatial partitioning using proximity.
- **Wave Function Collapse** (`wave_function_collapse/`) - Constraint-based pattern synthesis.
