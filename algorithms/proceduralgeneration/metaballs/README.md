# Metaballs Visualization (Nakama Style)

## Overview
This implementation creates organic, fluid-like 3D structures using metaballs (also known as blobby objects). The algorithm generates smooth, flowing surfaces that merge and separate dynamically, creating visually appealing organic forms suitable for procedural modeling, special effects, and artistic applications.

## Algorithm Description
Metaballs are 3D objects defined by implicit surfaces where multiple spherical influence fields combine to create smooth, organic shapes. When metaballs approach each other, their influence fields merge to create seamless connections, producing natural-looking blob formations.

### Mathematical Foundation
- **Implicit Surface Equations**: f(x,y,z) = threshold defines the surface
- **Influence Functions**: Spherical falloff functions for each metaball
- **Field Summation**: Combined influence creates merged surfaces
- **Marching Cubes**: Polygonization algorithm for mesh generation

### Key Features
1. **Dynamic Metaballs**: Moving and morphing spherical influence fields
2. **Surface Generation**: Real-time mesh creation using marching cubes
3. **Organic Animation**: Smooth deformation and merging behaviors
4. **Material Properties**: Configurable surface appearance and lighting
5. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient mesh updates and culling

## Algorithm Flow
1. **Metaball Definition**: Create spherical influence fields with positions and radii
2. **Field Evaluation**: Calculate combined influence at grid points
3. **Surface Detection**: Find isosurface using marching cubes algorithm
4. **Mesh Generation**: Create triangular mesh from surface data
5. **Animation Update**: Move metaballs and regenerate surface
6. **Rendering**: Display mesh with appropriate materials and lighting
