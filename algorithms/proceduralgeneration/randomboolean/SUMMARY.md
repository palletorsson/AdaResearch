## üéØ How It Works

### The CSG Setup
```
CSGCombiner3D (your script attached here)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CSGBox3D (operation = UNION) ‚Üê The solid base
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CSGSphere3D (operation = SUBTRACTION) ‚Üê Carves hole 1
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CSGSphere3D (operation = SUBTRACTION) ‚Üê Carves hole 2  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CSGSphere3D (operation = SUBTRACTION) ‚Üê Carves hole 3
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... more spheres along the path
```

### The Algorithm
1. **Create base shape** (cube, sphere, or cylinder)
2. **Generate path** using chosen algorithm:
   - Random Walk: Wander randomly, avoid crossing
   - Spiral: Helical path from bottom to top
   - Branches: Main trunk with side branches
   - Perlin: Follow noise field for smooth curves
   - Grid: Regular grid of straight tunnels
3. **Place subtractive spheres** at each point on path
4. **CSG automatically carves** by subtracting all spheres!

### Key Insight
The `operation = 2` (SUBTRACTION) on CSGSphere3D is what carves holes. The CSGCombiner3D combines all operations automatically.

- `cube_size` - Dimensions of solid shape (Vector3)
- `sphere_radius` - Size of carving spheres (float)
- `step_size` - Distance between spheres (float)

### Path Generation
- `walk_steps` - How many spheres to place (int)
- `avoid_self_crossing` - Prevent path from crossing itself (bool)
- `pattern` - Which algorithm to use (CarvePattern enum)

### Randomness
- `random_seed` - For reproducible results (-1 = random)
- `radius_variation` - Randomize sphere sizes (0.0 - 1.0)

---

## üé® The 5 Patterns

### 1. Random Walk (Default)
```
Organic, cave-like tunnels
Wanders randomly through space
Can avoid crossing itself
```
**Use**: Caves, organic tunnels, maze-like structures

### 2. Spiral
```
Helical path (like DNA or drill)
Spirals from bottom to top
Configurable turns and radius decay
```
**Use**: Wormholes, vortex effects, decorative sculptures

### 3. Branches
```
Tree-like structure
Main trunk with side branches
Configurable branching probability
```
**Use**: Root systems, veins, organic growth patterns

### 4. Perlin Path
```
Follows Perlin noise field
Smooth, flowing curves
Natural-looking movement
```
**Use**: Rivers, winding paths, smooth organic tunnels

### 5. Grid Tunnels
```
Regular grid of straight tunnels
Architectural/mechanical look
No randomness
```
**Use**: Ventilation systems, circuit boards, mechanical structures

## üí° Example Configurations

### Cave System
```gdscript
pattern = RANDOM_WALK
walk_steps = 60
sphere_radius = 0.5
avoid_self_crossing = true
```

### DNA Helix
```gdscript
pattern = SPIRAL
spiral_turns = 8.0
sphere_radius = 0.3
base_shape_type = "cylinder"
```

### Tree Roots
```gdscript
pattern = BRANCHES
max_branches = 10
branch_probability = 0.25
sphere_radius = 0.3
```

### Flowing River
```gdscript
pattern = PERLIN_PATH
perlin_scale = 0.2
perlin_strength = 2.0
sphere_radius = 0.6
```

### Circuit Board
```gdscript
pattern = GRID_TUNNELS
sphere_radius = 0.2
cube_size = Vector3(20, 2, 20)
show_path_line = false
```

---

## üéì Understanding CSG Operations

### Three Operations
```gdscript
OPERATION_UNION = 0         # Add (default)
OPERATION_INTERSECTION = 1  # Keep only overlap
OPERATION_SUBTRACTION = 2   # Remove/carve ‚≠ê
```

### How Subtraction Works
```
Base Cube (UNION)
    Volume = Solid cube
    
Subtract Sphere (SUBTRACTION)
    Volume = Sphere removed from cube
    
Result = Cube with spherical hole
```

Multiple subtractions stack:
```
Cube - Sphere1 - Sphere2 - Sphere3 = Cube with 3 holes
```

---

## üîß Customization Tips

### Smoother Tunnels
```gdscript
step_size = 0.3          # Closer spheres
sphere_radius = 0.5      # Overlap ensures continuity
```

### Wider Tunnels
```gdscript
sphere_radius = 0.8      # Bigger carving spheres
```

### More Organic
```gdscript
radius_variation = 0.3   # Vary sphere sizes
avoid_self_crossing = true
```

### Faster Generation
```gdscript
walk_steps = 30          # Fewer spheres
# In code, lower sphere detail:
sphere.radial_segments = 6
sphere.rings = 4
```

## üìä Performance Guide

| Walk Steps | Sphere Count | Generation Time | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| 20-30 | ~25 | < 0.5s | Testing, simple paths |
| 40-60 | ~50 | 1-2s | Standard tunnels |
| 80-100 | ~90 | 3-5s | Complex mazes |
| 150+ | ~150+ | 5s+ | Very detailed (slow) |

**Tip**: Start with 30-50 steps for testing, increase for final

---

## üéØ Common Use Cases

### 1. Procedural Cave Systems
```gdscript
# Multiple random walks = cave network
for i in range(5):
    var carver = random_walk_carver.new()
    carver.random_seed = i
    carver.walk_steps = 40
    add_child(carver)
```

### 2. Decorative Sculptures
```gdscript
# Spiral + sphere base = art piece
carver.pattern = SPIRAL
carver.base_shape_type = "sphere"
carver.spiral_turns = 6.0
```

### 3. Ventilation Ducts
```gdscript
# Grid pattern + small spheres
carver.pattern = GRID_TUNNELS
carver.sphere_radius = 0.2
carver.show_path_line = false
```

### 4. Organic Growth
```gdscript
# Branches + Perlin = roots/veins
carver.pattern = BRANCHES
carver.max_branches = 12
carver.branch_probability = 0.3
```

### 5. Level Design
```gdscript
# Predictable seed = same layout
carver.random_seed = 12345
carver.generate()
# Always generates same tunnel
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Path gets stuck | Disable `avoid_self_crossing` or increase `cube_size` |
| Spheres don't carve | Check operation is set to 2 (SUBTRACTION) |
| Tunnel is choppy | Decrease `step_size` or increase `sphere_radius` |
| Too slow | Reduce `walk_steps`, lower sphere detail |
| Path exits cube | Reduce `step_size`, increase `cube_size` |
