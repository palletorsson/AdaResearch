# CSG Boolean Carving - Fixes Applied

## 🐛 Problems Found and Fixed

### 1. **Wrong CSG Hierarchy** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Carving spheres were siblings of the base shape, not children
```
BEFORE (Wrong):
CSGCombiner3D
├── CSGBox3D (base)
├── CSGSphere3D (subtract) ← Won't work!
└── CSGSphere3D (subtract)

AFTER (Correct):
CSGCombiner3D
└── CSGBox3D (base)
    ├── CSGSphere3D (subtract) ← Works!
    └── CSGSphere3D (subtract)
```

**Fix:** Made carving spheres children of the base shape
```gdscript
// OLD
add_child(sphere)

// NEW
base_shape.add_child(sphere)
```

---

### 2. **Godot 4 Compatibility** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** `SurfaceTool.add_color()` doesn't exist in Godot 4

**Fix:**
```gdscript
// OLD (Godot 3)
st.add_color(color)

// NEW (Godot 4)
st.set_color(color)
```

---

### 3. **Crossing Check Distance Too Large** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Random walk couldn't find valid positions
- `step_size = 0.5` (small steps)
- `crossing_check_distance = 1.0` (blocks 2.0-unit diameter!)
- Result: After a few steps, all nearby positions blocked

**Fix:**
```gdscript
// OLD
step_size = 0.5
crossing_check_distance = 1.0

// NEW
step_size = 0.8  // Larger steps
crossing_check_distance = 0.6  // Tighter blocking
```

---

### 4. **CSG Processing Timing** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** CSG operations created before scene tree ready

**Fix:** Defer generation one frame
```gdscript
func _ready():
    if auto_generate:
        call_deferred("generate")  // Wait one frame
```

---

### 5. **Scene Nodes Being Deleted** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Generation cleared ALL children, including Label3D from scene

**Fix:** Only delete CSG-related nodes
```gdscript
// OLD
for child in get_children():
    child.queue_free()  // Deletes everything!

// NEW
for child in get_children():
    if child is CSGShape3D or child is MeshInstance3D:
        child.queue_free()  // Only CSG nodes
```

---

### 6. **Array Index Out of Bounds** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Branch pattern tried to access array indices that don't exist

**Fix:** Check array size before accessing
```gdscript
// NEW
if main_path.size() > 10:
    var safe_size = max(1, main_path.size() - 10)
    var branch_start_idx = randi() % safe_size
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Basic Random Walk
```
1. Open: algorithms/proceduralgeneration/randomboolean/randboolean.tscn
2. Press F6
3. Expected: Cube with carved tunnel
```

### Test 2: All 6 Patterns
```
1. Open: algorithms/proceduralgeneration/randomboolean/all_patterns_demo.tscn
2. Press F6
3. Expected: 6 carved shapes with different patterns
   - Random Walk: Winding tunnel
   - Spiral: Spiral-carved shape
   - Branches: Tree-like tunnels
   - Perlin Path: Smooth organic tunnel
   - Grid Tunnels: Grid of tunnels
   - Sphere + Spiral: Spiral through sphere
```

## 🎨 What You Should See Now

### Before (Your Screenshot)
- Solid cubes and sphere
- No visible holes
- Console said "complete" but nothing carved

### After (Now)
- ✅ Visible tunnels through shapes
- ✅ Complex carved patterns
- ✅ CSG boolean operations working
- ✅ All 6 patterns rendering

---

## 📊 Parameters to Adjust

### Make Tunnels Wider
```gdscript
sphere_radius = 0.6  // Default: 0.4
```

### Make Path Longer
```gdscript
walk_steps = 100  // Default: 50-60
```

### Allow Tighter/Looser Paths
```gdscript
crossing_check_distance = 0.4  // Tighter
crossing_check_distance = 1.0  // Looser
```

### Bigger/Smaller Base
```gdscript
cube_size = Vector3(15, 15, 15)  // Bigger
cube_size = Vector3(5, 5, 5)     // Smaller
```
