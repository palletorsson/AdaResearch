# üé® Marching Cubes Sculpture Gallery

Explore beautiful samples from the 4D noise marching cubes space - each sculpture is a unique region of the infinite density field.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Open** `sculpture_gallery.tscn`
2. **Press F6** to play the scene
3. **Wait** ~10-20 seconds for sculptures to generate
4. **Observe** 7 unique forms from the marching cubes space

---

## üé≠ What This Shows

The gallery displays **7 different samples** from the marching cubes 4D noise density field. Each sculpture demonstrates how different parameters create vastly different forms from the same underlying algorithm.

### The 7 Samples:

1. **Inside Cave** - Dense interconnected cave network
   - High iso-level (0.88) reveals internal structure
   - Noise scale 3.8, offset (150, -100, 200)

2. **Torus Sculpture** - Smooth donut-shaped form
   - Iso-level 0.0 creates balanced structure
   - Noise scale 2.0, centered offset

3. **Open Caverns** - Organic cavern structure
   - Mid iso-level (0.7) creates hollow spaces
   - Noise scale 2.5, offset (50, -50, 100)

4. **Dense Network** - Complex interconnected form
   - High noise scale (4.5) creates fine detail
   - Very high iso-level (0.95) isolates thin structures

5. **Flat Landscape** - Terrain-like structure
   - Very low iso-level (0.05) creates ground plane
   - Noise scale 3.5, offset (100, 50, 75)

6. **Crystal Formation** - Sharp angular features
   - High noise scale (5.0) creates detailed crystals
   - Mid iso-level (0.6), offset (300, 200, 100)

7. **Organic Blob** - Smooth flowing form
   - Low noise scale (1.8) creates large features
   - Low iso-level (0.3), offset (50, 100, 200)

## üî¨ What is 4D Noise Marching Cubes?

### The Process

1. **4D Noise Field** - An infinite field of density values
   - Uses 3D spatial coordinates (x, y, z)
   - Plus a 4th dimension for variation
   - Perlin/Simplex noise creates organic patterns

2. **Sampling** - Different regions produce different forms
   - **Noise Offset** - Where in the infinite field to sample
   - **Noise Scale** - Zoom level (smaller = larger features)
   - **Iso-Level** - Threshold for surface (0.0-1.0)

3. **Marching Cubes** - Extracts a triangular mesh
   - Scans through 3D grid of density values
   - Creates smooth surface where density crosses iso-level
   - Produces organic, cave-like forms

### Why It's Beautiful

- **Infinite variety** - Every offset samples a unique form
- **Organic shapes** - Noise creates natural-looking structures
- **Multi-scale** - Works at any size (caves, sculptures, terrain)
- **Procedural** - Fully algorithmic, no manual modeling

## üé® Gallery Features

### Element Tracing (Enabled)

The gallery uses **element tracing** to identify and color separate connected components:

- **Extracts islands** - Finds disconnected pieces of geometry
- **Colors each element** - Uses HSV color wheel for distinction
- **Reveals structure** - Shows how forms are composed

This helps you see:
- How many separate pieces exist
- Internal vs external surfaces
- Topology of the form

### Slow Rotation

Sculptures rotate slowly (0.08 rad/s) so you can observe them from all angles.

### Scaled Display

All sculptures scaled to ~0.5 for gallery viewing (originals are larger).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters Explained

### 1. **Noise Scale** (1.8 - 5.0)
Controls the "frequency" of noise features:
- **Low (1.8-2.5)** - Large, smooth blobs
- **Medium (3.0-4.0)** - Balanced detail
- **High (4.5-5.0)** - Fine, intricate patterns

### 2. **Iso-Level** (0.0 - 0.95)
The surface threshold:
- **Low (0.0-0.3)** - Solid forms, minimal holes
- **Medium (0.4-0.7)** - Balanced solid/hollow
- **High (0.8-0.95)** - Thin structures, many cavities

### 3. **Noise Offset** (Vector3)
Location in infinite 4D space:
- Different offsets = completely different forms
- Same offset + same parameters = identical result
- Offsets like seeds, but continuous

### 4. **Chunk Scale** (28 - 42)
Overall size of the sculpture in meters:
- Larger scale = bigger sculpture
- Doesn't change detail, just size

## üéÆ Customization

### In the Inspector (sculpture_gallery.tscn root node):

```gdscript
sculptures_per_row = 4       # Grid layout (4 = 2 rows of 4/3)
spacing = 15.0               # Distance between sculptures
sculpture_scale = 0.5        # Display scale (0.5 = half size)
enable_rotation = true       # Auto-rotate
rotation_speed = 0.08        # Rotation speed (slow)
trace_individual_elements = true  # Extract & color components
```

## üîß Modifying the Samples

To change what sculptures are shown, edit `marching_cubes_gallery.gd`:

```gdscript
var sculpture_configs = [
	{
		"name": "My Custom Sample",
		"noise_scale": 3.0,      # Feature size
		"iso_level": 0.5,        # Surface threshold
		"noise_offset": Vector3(100, 200, 300),  # Where to sample
		"chunk_scale": 35.0,     # Overall size
		"color": Color(1.0, 0.5, 0.8)  # Display color
	},
	# ... add more ...
]
```

## üåü Tips for Beautiful Forms

1. **High noise scale (4.0+)** - Intricate, detailed structures
2. **Medium iso-level (0.5-0.7)** - Interesting hollow/solid balance  
3. **Varied offsets** - Each region is unique, explore widely
4. **Low noise scale (1.5-2.5)** - Smooth, flowing blobs
5. **High iso-level (0.85+)** - Delicate, webbed structures

## üé® The Beauty of Sampling

Each sculpture is a **window into infinite space**. By changing the noise offset, you're sampling a different region of a field that extends forever in all directions. The same algorithm that creates terrain, caves, and landscapes also creates these beautiful abstract forms.

This gallery demonstrates that with the right algorithm, **infinite creativity** is just a matter of where you look! üîç‚ú®
