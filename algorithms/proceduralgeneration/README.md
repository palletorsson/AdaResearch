# Procedural Generation

## Overview
Procedural generation is a method of creating data algorithmically rather than manually. In the context of algorithms, it focuses on generating content, patterns, and structures through mathematical rules, algorithms, and randomness. This approach enables the creation of vast amounts of content with minimal manual input.
