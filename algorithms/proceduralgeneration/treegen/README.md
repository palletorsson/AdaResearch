# Procedural Tree Generation

## Overview
This implementation generates realistic tree structures using algorithmic growth patterns. The system simulates natural tree development through branching rules, environmental constraints, and organic growth patterns, creating diverse and believable tree models for games, visualizations, and artistic applications.

## Algorithm Description
The tree generation algorithm uses recursive branching with environmental influences to create natural-looking tree structures. It incorporates growth hormones, gravitational effects, light seeking behavior, and branch competition to simulate realistic tree development patterns.

### Key Components
1. **Branch Structure**: Hierarchical tree representation with parent-child relationships
2. **Growth Rules**: Probabilistic branching based on age, energy, and environment
3. **Environmental Factors**: Gravity, light direction, wind, and space constraints
4. **Organic Variation**: Random elements for natural asymmetry and uniqueness
5. **Resource Distribution**: Energy flow from roots through trunk to branches

### Growth Process
1. **Seed/Trunk**: Initialize main trunk with upward growth tendency
2. **Branch Sprouting**: Generate new branches based on growth hormones
3. **Environmental Response**: Adjust growth direction based on light/gravity
4. **Resource Allocation**: Distribute growth energy throughout tree structure
5. **Pruning**: Remove weak or conflicting branches
6. **Maturation**: Stabilize structure and add details (leaves, bark texture)

## Algorithm Flow
1. **Initialization**: Create root node and initial trunk segment
2. **Growth Iteration**: For each time step:
   - Calculate growth hormones at each node
   - Determine new branch directions and sizes
   - Apply environmental constraints
   - Update branch positions and orientations
3. **Collision Detection**: Prevent branches from intersecting
4. **Energy Distribution**: Simulate nutrient flow through structure
5. **Visualization**: Render 3D tree structure with appropriate materials
