# Graph Theory Algorithms

## Overview
This folder contains 3D visualizations of fundamental graph theory algorithms that model relationships and connections between entities. Graph theory is essential for network analysis, social media algorithms, transportation systems, and many other applications where relationships matter.

## What is Graph Theory?
Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph consists of vertices (nodes) connected by edges (links), representing relationships between entities.
