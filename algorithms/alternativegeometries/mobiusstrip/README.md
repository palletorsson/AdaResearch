# Möbius Strip Visualization

## Overview
This implementation creates interactive 3D visualizations of the Möbius strip, a fascinating mathematical surface with only one side and one boundary. The algorithm demonstrates non-orientable topology through dynamic mesh generation, allowing exploration of this fundamental object in topology and differential geometry.

## Algorithm Description
The Möbius strip generator creates a mathematical surface by taking a rectangular strip and joining the ends with a half-twist. This creates a non-orientable surface where traveling along the surface brings you back to the starting point but flipped. The algorithm provides various parameterizations and visualization techniques.
