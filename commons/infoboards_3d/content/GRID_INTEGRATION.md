# InfoBoards in Grid Maps - Integration Guide

## ✅ YES! `ib:point`, `ib:line`, `ib:triangle` Already Works!

The grid system **already has** InfoBoard support built-in. I've now updated it to use the centralized content system.

## How to Use in Your Maps

### In `map_data.json`:

```json
{
  "layers": {
    "utilities": [
      [" ", " ", " ", " ", " "],
      [" ", "ib:point", " ", " ", " "],
      [" ", " ", "ib:line", " ", " "],
      [" ", " ", " ", "ib:triangle", " "]
    ]
  }
}
```

**That's it!** The InfoBoards will automatically:
1. Load from `infoboard_content.json`
2. Use the UniversalInfoBoard template
3. Display all pages of content
4. Appear as handheld 3D tablets

## Available Boards

From your centralized content:

```
ib:point       // 5 pages - The Point: The Atom of Space
ib:line        // 5 pages - The Line: Connecting Points
ib:triangle    // 5 pages - The Triangle: The First Surface
ib:randomwalk  // 1 page - Random Walk: Exploring Through Chance
```

## Syntax Options

### Basic
```json
"ib:point"      // Load Point InfoBoard
```

### With Height Offset
```json
"ib:point:0.5"  // Raise board 0.5m above default
"ib:line:-0.2"  // Lower board 0.2m
```

## What Was Already There

The grid system had this implemented:

1. **UtilityRegistry.gd** (line 158-164)
   - `"ib"` registered as utility type
   - Marked as `supports_parameters: true`

2. **GridUtilitiesComponent.gd**
   - Lines 82-88: Detects `ib:` prefix
   - Lines 719-744: Parses InfoBoard utilities
   - Lines 747-812: Generates InfoBoards at positions

## What I Updated

Added universal template support so InfoBoards now:

1. **Try centralized content first** (from `infoboard_content.json`)
2. **Use UniversalInfoBoard template** (one script for all boards)
3. **Fall back to scene files** (for legacy boards)

This means you can add new boards just by editing JSON - no scene files needed!

## Testing

### Create a Test Map

`commons/maps/InfoBoards_Test/map_data.json`:

```json
{
  "map_info": {
    "name": "InfoBoard Test",
    "dimensions": {"width": 5, "depth": 5, "max_height": 2}
  },
  "layers": {
    "structure": [
      ["1", "1", "1", "1", "1"],
      ["1", "1", "1", "1", "1"],
      ["1", "1", "1", "1", "1"],
      ["1", "1", "1", "1", "1"],
      ["1", "1", "1", "1", "1"]
    ],
    "utilities": [
      [" ", " ", " ", " ", " "],
      [" ", "ib:point", "ib:line", "ib:triangle", " "],
      [" ", " ", " ", " ", " "],
      [" ", " ", "t", " ", " "],
      [" ", " ", " ", " ", " "]
    ]
  }
}
```

Load this map and you'll see all three InfoBoards in a row!

## Console Output

When working correctly, you'll see:

```
GridUtilitiesComponent: Generating utilities
GridUtilitiesComponent: Created 'point' InfoBoard using UniversalTemplate (Content: 5 pages)
GridUtilitiesComponent: Placed point info board at (1, 1, 1) (height offset: 0.0)
GridUtilitiesComponent: Created 'line' InfoBoard using UniversalTemplate (Content: 5 pages)
GridUtilitiesComponent: Placed line info board at (2, 1, 1) (height offset: 0.0)
GridUtilitiesComponent: Created 'triangle' InfoBoard using UniversalTemplate (Content: 5 pages)
GridUtilitiesComponent: Placed triangle info board at (3, 1, 1) (height offset: 0.0)
GridUtilitiesComponent: Added 4 utilities
```

## Real Example

Your existing `Point_1_1/map_data.json` uses `la:point` for labels.

You could add InfoBoards alongside:

```json
{
  "layers": {
    "utilities": [
      [" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "],
      [" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "],
      [" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "],
      [" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "],
      [" ", " ", "la:point", " ", "ib:point", " ", " "],
      [" ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " "]
    ]
  }
}
```

This puts a label at (2,4) and an InfoBoard at (4,4)!

## Integration with Existing System

The `ib:` utilities work alongside all other utilities:

```json
"utilities": [
  ["ib:point", "t", "el", "la:Example"],
  ["ib:line", "s", "wp", "r"],
  ["ib:triangle", " ", " ", " "]
]
```

Mix and match freely!

## Adding New Boards

To add a new InfoBoard:

1. **Add to `infoboard_content.json`:**
```json
"mesh": {
  "board_id": "mesh",
  "title": "Meshes",
  "pages": [...]
}
```

2. **Use in map:**
```json
"utilities": [["ib:mesh"]]
```

3. **Done!** No code, no scene files needed!

## Troubleshooting

### "No content found"
- Check `infoboard_content.json` has the board_id
- Verify spelling: `ib:point` not `ib:Point`

### Board doesn't appear
- Check console for errors
- Verify GridUtilitiesComponent is initialized
- Check utilities layer syntax is correct

### Wrong content showing
- Verify board_id matches JSON key exactly
- Check InfoBoardContentLoader is loading correct file

## Summary

**✅ The system was already there!**
**✅ Now updated to use centralized content!**
**✅ Works with `ib:point`, `ib:line`, `ib:triangle` syntax!**

Just add `ib:boardname` to your utilities layer and it works!
