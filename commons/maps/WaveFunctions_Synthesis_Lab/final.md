# The sum on the bench

A bench stands against the north wall of the laboratory. Above it a dark board carries a pale wave with five coloured rows beneath it, and the wave already has a shape when you arrive: a long slope down and a steep rise, four times across the board, drifting to the left. On the bench, at its right end, five sliders stand in a column, one for each row.

<!-- @additive_wave_demo -->

Read the rows before you touch anything. The top row is one smooth rise and fall per cycle; each row below has more, two, three, four, five, and each is drawn smaller than the one above. None of them looks like the pale wave. Press HOLD on the panel at the left of the bench and the drift stops, so a place on the board stays where it is.

Now take the four lower sliders down, one at a time, and keep your eye on the pale wave while each row leaves the ladder. What remains is the top row, drawn larger: a sine. Press BASELINE and the four return together; press H1 ALONE and they leave together. The shape you arrived at is not one thing with a slope in it. It is five smooth returns added, and the slope belongs to none of them.

Bring the second row back on its own slider and choose a place on the board. The amber line marked *mark* is one such place. Before you raise the third slider, decide what the sum will do there: the third row is at a crest, or crossing its middle, or in a trough, and its slider decides how much of that is admitted. Raise it and read the plate on the bench. Its third line lists each row's value at the mark; the fourth adds them and prints the total drawn beside them. They agree at every place, because the board draws both from one loop:

```gdscript
	var value = 0.0
	for h in range(harmonic_amplitudes.size()):
		value += harmonic_amplitudes[h] * sin(phase * (h + 1))
	return value
```

Row h is a sine at h + 1 times the phase, scaled by its coefficient, and the sum is the running total. There is no separate drawing of "the wave". The pale line is this loop evaluated 256 times across two metres,

```gdscript
const WAVE_POINTS: int = 256
const WAVE_LENGTH: float = 2.0  # Visual length in meters
const NUM_HARMONICS: int = 5
```

with the phase running four cycles across the board and the clock adding the drift you stopped with HOLD:

```gdscript
		var phase = t * TAU * 4.0 + _time * TAU
```

A slider changes exactly one number. When a handle moves, the instrument reads the handle's position back as that row's coefficient:

```gdscript
		harmonic_amplitudes[harmonic_index] = harmonic_sliders[harmonic_index].get_normalized_value()
```

Even the first slider only changes how much of the first return is present. Nothing on this bench changes the fundamental's frequency, and the rows' frequencies are fixed integers, so the whole vocabulary here is five amounts. BASELINE returns them to the table the room was placed with:

```gdscript
		"sawtooth":
			# Sawtooth: all harmonics, amplitude 1/n
			_set_amplitudes([1.0, 0.5, 0.333, 0.25, 0.2])
```

one over n, all five present, the recipe the label calls a sawtooth. The plate's last line names every coefficient that differs from this table, so you can wander and still know how far you have gone.

With the baseline held, look at the rise. A sawtooth rises in no distance at all; this one climbs from its trough to its crest over about nine centimetres of a fifty-centimetre cycle, and the slope before it ripples where a sawtooth would be straight, roughly once per row. Raise the fifth slider and the ripples change; nothing you do with five sliders straightens the slope, and the plate's total never passes about one and a half. Five returns can suggest a corner and cannot make one. From across the room the pale line is a sawtooth. At the bench it is a sum.

Build a shape with no name. Take the second and fourth rows out and leave the odd three; the label offers a name. Move one of the three off its table value and the label gives the name up. Then remove the row you think matters least and find where its absence shows. It is not in one place, because each row runs the whole cycle.

Everything this bench does can be done again: five numbers and one loop give the same board every time, and BASELINE proves it by bringing you back. The next room begins with a result that looks as involved as this one and asks whether it can be brought back at all.
